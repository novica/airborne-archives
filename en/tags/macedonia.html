Here is the latest. For the full text visit the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/20180417-the-former-yugoslav-republic-of-macedonia-report.pdf">ec.europa.eu</a> site [link to file in PDF].</p>
<p><strong>5.7. Chapter 7: Intellectual property law</strong></p>
<p><em>The EU has harmonised rules for the legal protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs), as well as rules for the legal protection of copyright and related rights. Rules for the legal protection of IPRs cover, for instance, patents and trademarks, designs, biotechnological inventions and pharmaceuticals. Rules for the legal protection of copyright and related rights cover, for instance, books, films, computer programmes and broadcasting.</em></p>
<p>The country is <strong>moderately prepared</strong> in this area. Some progress, although limited, was made in improving the legal framework on copyright and on protected designation of quality.</p>
<p>In the coming year, the country should in particular continue to: </p>
<ul><li>step up efforts to investigate and prosecute infringements of intellectual property;</li>
<li>strengthen the collective management system;</li>
<li>improve coordination among the law enforcement institutions, establishing an information platform for exchange of data and raise public awareness on the importance of protecting<br />
intellectual property rights according to EU best practices.</li>
</ul><p>As regards <strong> copyright and related rights</strong>, following the licence revocation in 2016, the collective management of related rights exists only for music rights. The fees for the rights that are owed by the phonogram producers are no longer collected. The unit responsible in the Ministry of Culture remains understaffed. Both national and international cooperation remains very limited. </p>
<p>In the area of <strong>industrial rights</strong>, the State Office for Industrial Property continued the strategic cooperation with the European Patent Office, the World Intellectual Property Office and the European Union Intellectual Property Office. The 2016-2018 strategy on industrial property was adopted following delays but without an update of the relevant action plan, which risks undermining its credibility. Information campaigns were launched on the threats that counterfeit goods can cause to public health. However, their organisation lacked ownership and relied heavily on donor-funding. The State Office for Industrial Property declined to set up the information platform for the exchange of IPR-related data among law enforcement institutions. There are still challenges as regards providing good quality services to the public. </p>
<p>Infringements of intellectual property rights are frequent, but the absence of reliable statistics on their handling by the law enforcement institutions prevents a credible <strong>enforcement</strong> record from being established. Measures taken by the Coordination Body for Intellectual Property are rare and mostly target infringement of trademarks. This body lacks political support and its funding remains insufficient to fulfil its mandate, raise public awareness or educate the right-holders about the importance of intellectual property rights.</p>

On june 22 at 1:10 PM I downloaded (probably) all 1142 tweets that contained the two hashtags used for communicating with the new minister for health of Macedonia: PërshëndetjeTaravari and #ЗдравоТаравари (Albanian and Macedonian language of the hashtag). Those are tweets from a period of around 72 hours.</p>
<p>If the retweets are removed then what remains is 294 original tweets using the hashtags. The volume of tweets (left) and retweets (right) can be seen below. The high volume of tweets and retweets occur in the morning and evening hours. However, it seems that the excitement from the first 36 hours dwindles in the second 36 hours of the chosen period.</p>
<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4236/34682221394_8d115dde1f_c.jpg" width="800" height="334" alt="tweets_retweets" /></p>
<p>This trend might mean that political marketing among Macedonian twitter users is short lived. It seems that even bad jokes aimed at the minister (example: "#HelloTaravari should I eat meat or cheese pie for breakfast?" - sent by  @dRskata1 on June 22 at 10:37 AM) don't last more than 3 days. On June 22, just three days after the campaign started the number of original tweets using the hashtags is less then 5 per hour.</p>
<p>The three leading twitter users that use the hashtag to write original tweets are <a href="https://twitter.com/evilblonddemon">@evilblonddemon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LOshGZE">@LOshGZE</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Carbonoxid">@Carbonoxid</a> with 28, 16 and 13 tweets respectively.</p>
<p>However, when the leading #HelloTaravari twitter users are compared to the leading tweeter users from the rankings done at Time.mk (T-index, Top by Reach и Top by Followers), there is only one tweeter account (@evilblonddemon) that is present among the most active / most popular 20 users both generally in Macedonia and using #HelloTaravari. This might be an indicator that political campaigns are not of special interest among those Macedonian twitter users that create the leading content on twitter. </p>
<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4218/35523560245_e3fe87a142_c.jpg" width="800" height="334" alt="distribution.twitterers" /></p>
<p>The analysis of the distribution of occurrence of the hashtag since the beginning of the campaign shows that most of the active accounts show up once or twice, while only 25 twitter accounts have 10 or more tweets and retweets with the hashtag #HelloTaravari. The most active accounts have 40 to 60 tweets and retweets  during the 72 hour period, ore one tweet every 1.2 -1.8 hours (72 - 108 minutes).</p>
<p>At the and, almost all of the collected 1142 tweets use the Macedonian hashtag. Beside the original ministry announcement tweet, a tweet with a link to a news outlet PortAlb, and a tweet asking if the hashtag is used, every other (seven) tweets are retweets of the ministry's announcement. This means that a total of nine tweets have used the Albanian hashtag in the first 72 hours of the campaign. This might be an indication of the number of twitter users in Macedonia that speak Albanian, as well as indication that the Ministry of health should choose a different channel to talk to with Albanian-speaking citizens instead of Twitter.</p>

<p>The report found that: </p>
<p>"Acting on the basis of Articles 175 and 176 of the Law on Electronic Communication, each of the three national telecommunications providers equips the UBK with the necessary technical apparatus, enabling it to mirror directly their entire operational centres. As a consequence, from a practical point of view, the <strong>UBK can intercept communications directly, autonomously and unimpeded, regardless of whether a court order has or has not been issued in accordance with the Law on Interception of Communications.</strong>". (Emphasis mine.) </p>
<p>Then it recommended that: </p>
<p>"The UBK should have no direct access to the technical equipment allowing mirroring of the communication signal. The proprietary switches should be moved to the premises of the telecommunication providers. The providers should activate and divert signals to the competent law enforcement agencies (Police, Customs Administration and Financial Police) or the security agencies (the Security and Counterintelligence Service (UBK), the Intelligence Agency, and the Ministry of Defence's military security and intelligence service) only upon receipt of the relevant court order, and only for the purposes of lawful interceptions. <strong>Under no circumstances should the UBK have the practical capability to capture communications directly.</strong>" (Emphasis mine.) </p>
<p>Nevertheless, amendments to the Law on electronic communications <strong>are not included</strong>* in <a href="http://sdsm.org.mk/News.aspx?idNews=7681&amp;lng=1">proposed Government program</a> by Zoran Zaev published on 10.03.2017. (*The document is unsearchable, so this claim is based on reading the parts that refer to human rights.)</p>
<p>This outcome in the proposed Government program is in contradiction to the statements made by Mr. Zaev that the "Priebe" reforms will be a priority for the new administration. For example:</p>

</ul><p>The proposed program promises to open a debate for a broader support to amend the Law on interception of communications. Although amending this law is needed and in line with "Priebe", amending it, according to established practice, requires <a href="http://kajgana.com/izglasani-izmenite-na-zakonot-za-sledenje-na-komunikacii">2/3 majority vote in Parliament</a>. Given the current distribution of parties and MPs a 2/3 vote seems impossible, so it looks reasonable for the Zaev administration to seek broader support, without a straighforward promise that the Law on interception of communications will be amended.</p>
<p>However, to amend the Law on electronic communications such majority is not needed. For example the amendments from June 2010 were passed with 65 MPs voding of which 55 voted yes, 1 abstained, and 9 voted against. The Macedonian parliament has 120 MPs.  So, unless I'm terribly misreading the poorly published document, the amendments to end UBK's capability to capture communications directly are not part of the proposed government program.</p>

In the early days of this political, social, and moral crisis, I noted that the opposition party SDSM, specifically its president Zoran Zaev, frist implicated the telecommunications operators in Macedonia as collaborators in the warrant-less wiretapping, only to backtrack on that statement few weeks later.</p>
<p><em>In his early statements (12.02.2015) Zoran Zaev claimed that <a href="http://vistinomer.mk/zaev-samo-mobilnite-operatori-mozhat-da-dozvolat-za-da-se-sledi-niven-korisnik/">the wiretapping could not have happened</a> without the knowledge of the operators, but just two weeks later (27.02.2015) Zaev said that the operators have no responsibility whatsoever at a press-conference for bombshell #5.</em> -- from <a href="../node/839.html">The silence of the telecom operators</a>, June 4 2015.</p>
<p>The telecommunications operators also maintained that they worked and still work within the law.</p>
<p>All of these claims were proved wrong today, November 18 2016, when at the <a href="http://www.jonsk.mk/2016/11/18/%d0%b8%d0%b7%d1%98%d0%b0%d0%b2%d0%b0-%d0%be%d0%b4-%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%81-%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bd%d1%84%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%86%d0%b8%d1%98%d0%b0/"> Special prosecutor press conference</a> (link in Macedonian) it was revealed that:</p>
<p><em>„Тhe unlawful wiretapping of several thousands people that lived in the Republic of Macedonia in the period from 2008 to 2015 violated the privacy of their personal and family life, and the secrecy of communications"</em></p>
<p>The equipment that is installed in the operators' networks and is used for surveillance of communication in a way in which the secret police has 'direct, autonomous, and uninterrupted' access is allowed by law only in a part of the period from 2008 to 2015. This period includes 1. the months from June 2010 when the new law for electronic communications came into power, until December 2010 when the Constitutional Court canceled the articles regarding the equipment and access, and 2. the period since February 2014 when the new law for electronic communications came into power, that has the same canceled provisions (on which, this time, the Constitutional Court is silent for more than a year). </p>
<p>In fact, in the eight-year period from 2008 to 2015, direct, autonomous, and uninterrupted access was allowed by law in only 2.5 years. This means that the operators allowed conventional access (i.e. in a way that the secret police does not access their network autonomously at their will) knowing that there is no court order for such an access to peoples' communications, or that the equipment for direct, autonomous, and uninterrupted access was working during the entire period, even when there was no law allowing that. In the latter case it would mean that such access was made available to the secret police 2 years before the law allowing it was even discussed in Parliament. </p>
<p>Today's SPO press conference casts a serious doubt on the claims that operators worked according to prescribed laws. The law requires that telecommunications operators must cooperate with the SPO. Morality requires that their executives at least tender their resignations.</p>

<p><strong>4.7. Chapter 7: Intellectual property law</strong></p>
<p><em>The EU has harmonised rules for the legal protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs), as well as rules for the legal protection of copyright and related rights. Rules for the legal protection of IPRs cover, for instance, patents and trademarks, designs, biotechnological inventions and pharmaceuticals. Rules for the legal protection of copyright and related rights cover, for instance, books, films, computer programmes and broadcasting.</em></p>
<p>The country is <strong>moderately prepared</strong> in this area. <strong>Some progress</strong>, although limited, was made during the reporting period. There is still no strategy on intellectual property. In thecoming year, the country should in particular:</p>
<ul><li>improve consultation of the stakeholders when drafting legislation;</li>
<li>step up efforts to investigate and prosecute infringements of intellectual property;</li>
<li>reinforce capacity and coordination among the authorities in charge of implementing the intellectual property laws and raise public awareness of the importance of protecting intellectual property rights.</li>
</ul><p>On <strong>copyright and neighbouring</strong> rights, the law on copyrights was amended in February 2016 to regulate the functioning of collective management of rights and remuneration distribution and to abolish the cap to remunerations of right-holders, but the collective management system is still underdeveloped. The system for electronic recording of broadcast music works needs to be finalised. The Ministry of Culture revoked the licence of one of the collecting societies, with the result that certain fees are no longer collected, and subsequently (in July) licensed one more society in the areas of music rights. The capacity of the Ministry of Culture to deal with copyright and neighbouring rights remains insufficient.</p>
<p>As regards <strong>industrial rights</strong>, the State Office of Industrial Property concluded a bilateral cooperation agreement with the European Patent Office for 2016-18 and made its database available to the public. Challenges remain, in particular in providing services to the public.</p>
<p>The number of court cases on infringements of intellectual property rights is still low and there is no credible <strong>enforcement</strong> record. The Agency for Audiovisual Media Services conducted inspections and found certain irregularities by broadcasters. The functions of the Coordinative Body for Intellectual Property do not cover the coordination of policy-making and of legislative work. Its funding is insufficient and there is no budget for awareness-raising and education of right-holders and the public about the importance of intellectual property rights. Coordination between the enforcement authorities is insufficient.</p>

<p><strong>4.7.  Chapter 7: Intellectual property law</strong></p>
<p><em>The EU has harmonised rules for the legal protection of copyright and related rights. This covers, for instance, computer programs, broadcasting and trademarks, designs, biotechnological inventions and pharmaceuticals.</em>  </p>
<p>The country is <strong>moderately prepared</strong> in this area. <strong>Some progress</strong> was made on customs enforcement. The commitment and capacities of the institutions responsible for enforcing and protecting intellectual property rights and the <em>acquis</em> vary, but remain insufficient. A satisfactory track record on investigation, prosecution and judicial handling of piracy and counterfeiting is lacking. Public awareness campaigns are not yet well developed. In the coming year, the country should in particular:<br />
→ step up efforts to investigate and prosecute infringements of intellectual property. </p>
<p>On <strong>copyright and neighbouring rights</strong>, the Ministry of Culture adopted a rulebook on record-keeping of authors’ rights and holders of related rights. The Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Information Society and Administration jointly established a system for electronic recording of broadcast music works. The government has not yet approved the tariff schemes of collective rights management societies and the capacity of the Ministry of Culture to deal with copyright and neighbouring rights is still insufficient. </p>
<p>On <strong>industrial property rights</strong>, the State Office for Industrial Property cooperated with the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market and with the European Patent Office on several projects, but the trademark databases of the first two should be better integrated. The State Office does not have enough staff to provide good quality services or training to the public and the business community, nor to cooperate internationally. </p>
<p>Some progress was made on <strong>enforcement</strong> of intellectual property rights. The Coordination Body for Intellectual Property has had a positive impact but the level of commitment differs between law enforcement institutions and sharing responsibility between 11 different law enforcement bodies hinders more efficient investigation and legal actions. The State Market Inspectorate lacks basic equipment, IT and training to ensure effective enforcement. The Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services issued 10 orders to broadcasters to prevent further violations of copyright and neighbouring rights. Some 30 misdemeanour cases were lodged with the courts, but the absence of a credible enforcement record hinders information on the follow-up action taken. The three public laboratories are still not legally authorised to detect and analyse counterfeit medicines, so their evidence is not accepted in court. Public awareness of the threats posed by counterfeit goods to health and safety remains limited.</p>

This is nothing new, since I have been writing about this <a href="../../node/830.html">obligation</a> for a long time. However, when a European expert does that it resounds much louder in the public: </p>
<p><em>Acting on the basis of Articles 175 and 176 of the Law on Electronic Communication, each of the three national telecommunications providers equips the UBK with the necessary technical apparatus, enabling it to mirror directly their entire operational centres. As a consequence, from a practical point of view, the UBK can intercept communications directly, autonomously and unimpeded, regardless of whether a court order has or has not been issued in accordance with the Law on Interception of Communications. (Pages 5-6 of the report of 8th of June 2015 of the expert group of the European Commission).</em></p>
<p>The report of the experts group confirms two things: the equipment exists at the operators’ premises and that equipment is in use. </p>
<p>Still, the question that we constantly seek answer to is since when is the equipment in use? There is less and less doubt that the UBK, operating without court order breached the laws and the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, but did he operators follow suit? </p>
<p>Articles 175 and 175 of the Law on electronic communications are valid since February 2014 when the said law was voted by the Parliament (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 39/2014). However, we heard from the recordings and the journalistic analysis the conversations took place at different time periods and there are recordings even since 2011. How could have these recordings been made if the Direction had not been allowed to “ mirror directly their entire operational centres?” </p>
<p>Infact, with the changes of the Law on electronic communications of 2010 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 83/2010) the equipment was set at the operators. However, shortly afterwards, in December 2010 the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia canceled the articles of the law that allow “ direct, autonomous and unimpeded” wiretapping. The cancellation means that this access of DBK to the operators is illegal, and their obligation is to stop it. If that Decision of the Constitutional Court was respected, then how come there are recordings from 2011 (one example is the destruction of “Kosmos” building)? </p>
<p>The operators <a href="../../node/839.html">maintain</a> hat they had acted according to the law, but there are hundreds of recordings that suggest otherwise. The proverb goes, where there is smoke there is fire. They make no effort to restore the public thrust with regards to their handling of the users’ data. At the same time, the Agency for electronic communication and the Direction for personal data protection which are in charge of surveillance of the telecommunications and the right to privacy of the users remain calm and indifferent to the mass abuse that we are witnessing.</p>
<p>The Occam’s razor is a principle stating that out of possible hypothesis we should choose the one containing the least assumptions. This is it: The operators did not switch off the equipment installed in 2010 and breached the decision of the Constitutional court and allowed continuous wiretapping even when the law did not provide this obligation. </p>
<p>The operators were entrusted with an important and responsible role in society, and according to the laws they have to take care of the privacy and the confidentiality of their users’ data they have access to. In times when digital communications play an increasingly significant role in the social and political activities their responsibility increases. If they want to show us that they are up for the challenge and that the aforementioned hypothesis is incorrect, then they can publish the acts by which their directors order switching off and dismantling of the equipment that allowed direct access to communications according to the Decision of the Constitutional court. If those acts contain classified information, we will be satisfied with documents containing black fields as those from the movies. Until then: where there is smoke there is fire.  </p>

They claim that the recordings contain alleged scandals, corruption, and abuses made by the leading people in the Government and the ruling political parties. They also claim that these recordings are not just some or few recordings that are made by accident, but that they are a small part of the millions of files of surveillance of communications of over 20000 citizens in Macedonia. While the main narrative stays the same, a part of the story changed over time: the part about the role of the telecom operators in this affair. In his early statements (12.02.2015) Zoran Zaev claimed that <a href="http://vistinomer.mk/zaev-samo-mobilnite-operatori-mozhat-da-dozvolat-za-da-se-sledi-niven-korisnik/">the wiretapping could not have happened</a> without the knowledge of the operators, but just two weeks later (27.02.2015) Zaev said that the operators have no responsibility whatsoever at a press-conference for bombshell #5.</p>
<p>Since these statements raised suspicion about what exactly happened regarding the alleged mass surveillance of 20000 people, in February I started researching the laws. <a href="../../node/830.html">The analysis of that time</a> led me to the following revelations:</p>
<p>1. Article 115 paragraph 2 of the Law for electronic communications allowed for usage of mass surveillance technology in June 2010;<br />
2. This legal arrangement was made null and void (luckily) just 6 months later when the Constitutional court made its decision in December 2010;<br />
3. The same legal provisions were reintroduced to the law in February 2014 when the new Law for electronic communications entered into force.</p>
<p>According to many sources (the opposition, journalists, political analysts) large part of the recordings were made between 2011-2014. Therefore the logical question, when the claim that 20000 people were under surveillance is undisputed,what happened with the (shortly legal) technology from 2010 in the period from 2010 to 2014?</p>
<p>Logically, at least for me, was to ask this question to the operators (T-Mobile, Makedonski Telekom, VIP and One) and to the regulator (AEK) in the following form:</p>
<p>1. Which actions did the operator take to comply with the decision of the Constitutional court of Republic of Macedonia U. No. 139/2010-0-1 from 15.12.2010?</p>
<p>2.  Which actions did the Agency for electronic communications take in order to determine whether the telecom operators complied with the decision of the Constitutional court of Republic of Macedonia U. No. 139/2010-0-1 from 15.12.2010?</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the number of cases for which the courts have allowed special investigative measures, which include <a href="http://it.com.mk/naredbite-za-sleden-e-na-komunikaciite-se-duplirale-vo-poslednite-pet-godini/">surveillance of communications</a>, is a publicly available information, it was logical to ask the operators how many requests have they received individually, especially regarding the retained data of their users. This is a completely statistical information: if we know that in 2013 there were 226 approved requests for surveillance of communication, then the information how many requests were received by each operator will tell us only what was the involvement of each operator. </p>
<p>All of these FOI requests were denied, mostly by claiming that any answer will be a breach of "classified information". Only AEK did not respond at all. For all of the FOI requests I submitted a complaint to the Commission for protection of the right to free access of information of public interest, and now I wait for their response. I hope the Commission will find that to answer the question about complying to a court order and anonymous statistics cannot be hidden from the public.</p>
<p>Until we have their answer, visit this <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/116579651078810464610/FOIRequests">galery</a> for the answers from the operators (in Macedonian).</p>

<p>In several recordings played today we hear Interior ministry officials (allegedly Minister Gordana Jankulovska and press officer Ivo Kotevski) discussing Nikola Mladenov's death, the investigation, withholding evidence, using the Ministry's surveillance equipment to find his position via his phone, and the capacity of the judge to complete the proceedings. They laugh and joke about the death of the journalist, denouncing everyone who is asking questions about the accident as 'a communist' (specific Macedonian jargon is 'komunjar') which is a derogative word.</p>
<p>The recordings also show Interior ministry officials plot to send life threatening messages to journalists as 'a joke' following the death of Mladenov, by phone and at his funeral, and also mention threats towards jailed and now released investigative journalist Tomislav Kezarovski   </p>
<p>Minutes after the press conference held by SDSM's president Zoran Zaev ended, the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party issued a statement supporting a new, independent investigation into the death of Nikola Mladenov.</p>

That was one of the key points of Radmila Sekerinska's speech at the meeting in Universal Hall on 10th March 2015. To quote:</p>
<p><cite>We do not seek support to change one Sasho or Nikola with another of the same type. We seek support to take responsibility and to change things.</cite></p>
<p>In this context the issue of authentic interpretation of the law for amnesty is a strange political move. SDSM is accusing Nikola Gruevski  for "false patriotism". Why? Is that a felony? More important, VMRO supporters almost  certainly will not hold this against Gruevski, because they are well trained to know that without the interpretation, SDSM would have regained power. The last is discussed in an <a href="../../node/639.html">analysis</a> of clumsy and unprincipled PR activities of both parties in 2011. For whose benefit is the allegation of "false patriotism"? Does SDSM promise a new legal resolution for these cases, as they do for media freedom and law on communications? Have they reached an agreement about this with theirs expected coalition partner DUI?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is well known that the authentic interpretation is a political move and it is probable to expect that the same thing would have be done by any Macedonian government, including one that would include SDSM. There is a diplomatic cable published on Wikileaks where we can read that SDSM <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06SKOPJE152_a.html">calculated</a> with the cases before the elections in 2006. Quote:</p>
<p><cite>Prime Minister Buckovski told the EU Special Representative on February 10 that the government’s decision to ask for the cases “by the end of this year” was deliberately ambiguous. Ethnic Macedonians would understand that the cases finally were coming back for possible prosecution, answering past criticism that only ethnic Macedonians — such as former Interior Minister Boskovski, currently facing a war crimes trial in The Hague — had been called to account for their participation in the 2001 conflict. DUI would receive some satisfaction from the private knowledge that the first of the cases would probably not be returned until late 2006, and that the primary defendant in that case likely would be former NLA commander Daut Rexhepi (also known as Commander Leka), who is currently associated with rival ethnic Albanian party DPA.</cite></p>
<p>To refresh everybody's memory, the cases were send to ICTY by the broad coalition government <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/8069">just ten</a> days before the elections in 2002, and with that any work on the cases was delayed for at least four years. There is another cable on  Wikileaks where we can read that Gruevski was <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08SKOPJE607_a.html">not ambivalent </a> towards the fact that he inherited this issue. Quote:</p>
<p><cite>Gruevski replied that he understood the point, but he is in a delicate position politically. He would have no problem if the Chief Prosecutor or the courts ruled that the amnesty law indeed applies and the cases are dropped, but he believes he cannot take a stand on the issue other than to let the cases proceed. He is concerned that the main ethnic-Albanian parties, DPA and DUI, may soon introduce a measure asking parliament to take a stand on the issue. While he understood that his coalition deal with DUI could be on the line, he told us that he cannot go along with criticizing the prosecutions and then face the ethnic-Macedonian community, especially because the ICTY recently convicted ethnic-Macedonian former MoI official Johan Tarculovski of war crimes.</cite></p>
<p>At the end, the 'bombshel' completely favors DUI's leader Ali Ahmeti. If he is powerful enough to negotiate something like this (and he obviously was), then the Albanians will love him even more. This goes against the promises that the 'bombshells' will not spare anyone's crime, including the Albanian parties. Therefore there is not any logical explanation why SDSM is releasing these recordings...? What is the goal? Strengthening DUI?  Inter-ethnic turbulence?</p>
<p>In short, SDSM does not have a different principled or legal standing regarding the 'war crimes' cases, the release of the recordings will not trouble VMRO supporters since they already know that the amnesty is the lesser evil, and finally, it will not help the reconciliation of both communities.</p>
<p>Then there are the media. Prizma <a href="http://prizma.birn.eu.com/%D0%BC%D0%BA/%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B8/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0-%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%B0-%D1%85%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%B8-%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5-%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D0%BE-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B1%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8">writes</a>:</p>
<p><cite>The four cases were processed in ICTY, but in 2008 were returned to Macedonian courts.</cite></p>
<p>What does „processed“ mean? The US cable is more precise:</p>
<p><cite>ICTY agreed to review the cases in 2002, but the tribunal declined to prosecute — or even investigate — and returned the files to Macedonia.</cite></p>
<p>The journalists write that the conversation published by SDSM are 'alleged conversations between government ministers', but they do not write that the issue is 'alleged war crimes'. Unfortunately, those events are 'alleged' in the legal sense until a court decides otherwise. And since ICTY did not even undertake an investigation about these cases, who from the Macedonian political elite is going to be responsible for the delay? What if during the years when these cases were sitting in a bottom drawer in the Hague, in Macedonia someone was destroying related evidence?</p>
<p>But let's go back to the laws. The authentic interpretation most probably is irrelevant. If it is against international law (<a href="https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?mtdsg_no=IV-6&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en">UN Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes</a>  and other conventions ratified by Macedonia), and ratified conventions when ratified have priority over domestic law, then a future chief prosecutor may say that the authentic interpretation is void and reopen the cases. This kind of epilogue is possible. A new parliament can even vote on a different legal obligations. Do we have a promise that this will happen?</p>
<p>Moreover, the Macedonian justice system had an opportunity to work on one of these cases. What if they saw that there is nowhere to go? Public commentary, recommendations and request from organizations such as <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-macedonia-2013?page=show">Amnesty International</a>, are that there should be a court closure, but that does not mean that it will be with a *positive outcome for the victims*:</p>
<p><cite>Macedonia’s international obligations are to thoroughly and impartially investigate all cases returned from the ICTY and, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, to ensure that all those allegedly responsible for violations of international humanitarian law are brought to justice.</cite></p>
<p>So, when we already have (from the Wikileaks cable above) OSCE's expert opinion that from what they saw Macedonia  does not have enough evidence, nor good enough prosecutors and judges (despite plenty of training) to work on the cases:</p>
<p><cite>Additionally, OSCE has official observer status and has had the opportunity to review the files. Their experts here characterize the evidence they have seen as relatively scanty and the prosecutors and judges as apparently unprepared, despite being trained.</cite></p>
<p>and that Macedonian representatives from the government, specifically the chief prosecutor, said that there is not enough evidence:</p>
<p><em>Protoger added that the Chief Prosecutor told him that it appears that there is solid evidence against only four of the 19 defendants in the Mavrovo case, and Xhemaili is not one of them. (Which begs the question why the other 15 are being tried at all.)</em></p>
<p>then, is it not better for the whole society to forget about the cases and try heal the wounds, then to go to court, where the victims might lose, and their alleged torturers to claim judicial victory?</p>
<p>Think about this for a moment. What if there is a complete court process after which there will be a verdict that the indicted persons are not guilty? What effect will it have on the society? The easiest thing is to talk about not following the law and that Macedonia is ignoring international legal norms, but is there something else that in this particular case matters and should be taken into account? Is it even possible in an ethnically divided state where the minority continuously does not have trust in the judicial system, and the majority thinks that there should not be any protests regarding court decisions (like in the "Monstrum" case), to have a trial like the ones being pushed under the rug?</p>
<p>Furthermore, any such trial would have to happen in conditions, as heard in other leaked recordings presented by SDSM, where the "judiciary is corrupted and incompetent". How come that we expect courts to deal with complicated war cases, when they cannot deal with relatively easier corruption cases? Or, now that we know that the courts "belong to Mijalkov and the family", would we request that VMRO process the cases and ask for a "politically pleasant" verdicts?</p>
<p>What if the decision to have authentic interpretation, beside the political pragmatism to keep the coalition together, VMRO and Gruevski saved time, money, nerves and everything else that could have been costly for the victims' families? Did they offered reconciliation and showed forgiveness on behalf of ethnic Macedonians instead of opening old wounds? Did they created from the ethnic Macedonians  political winners willing to forgive instead of legal losers who will have new grievance? These are unpleasant questions to which the published content in the 'bombshell' offers no answer, and to which we will probably avoid to answer in the future as well.  </p>
<p>Maybe this 'bombshell' is just to encourage DUI, with the help of the US. Let's hope it will not create new inter-ethnic tensions.</p>

<p>Over the past few days Stojanche Angelov the president of the right wing party Dostoinstvo was trying to enter the state television and deliver the leaked recordings to the reporters who work there. According to  the editor at the state television they are not airing any of those recordings because they are following public prosecutor's instructions which by many are considered ill placed.</p>
<p>The visit of Mr. Angelov had a twist when the radio hosts of Kanal 103 (the independent music radio that airs from the state tv building) saw him in the hallway and invited him to come to their talk show. The private security that guards the building stopped Mr. Angelov and didn't allowed him to go to Kanal 103 studio.</p>
<p>Later that evening the security officers barged in Kanal 103 studio <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gocemitevski/upad-kanal103-13-03-2015">interrupting the program and demanding</a> that the person working provides a valid ID card before he can continue with the show.</p>
<p>Earlier that day we witnessed how the leading <a href="http://therealpsmst.tumblr.com/post/113509431103">opposition weekly Fokus</a> and the on-line outlet NovaTV changed the reporting on the latest leaks released on Thursday. One of the tapes there was an alleged conversation between chief of secret police Sasho Mijalkov and Sitel TV editor Dragan Pavlovikj where they discuss that then opposition leader and ex-president Branko Crvenkovski offered voters exchange on local elections between Karposh and Centar municipalities in Skopje.</p>
<p>NovaTV first published the whole recording, then removed and published again. According to its editor that was done to remove "<a href="https://twitter.com/BorjanJovanovsk/status/576373070484606976">private conversation (gossip)</a>". Almost simultaneously Focus changed its on-line reporting from "an official statement of SDSM's press person" to "unofficial sources from the party" that the recording was aired in full by mistake and that the staff at the party forgot to remove private conversations, including the part concerning Mr. Crvenkovski.</p>
<p>This, obviously, raises concerns that previous recordings are "cleaned up" to remove parts that could produce bad publicity for the opposition. At the same it becomes less clear how the opposition party and the media who are reporting on the recordings decide what are "private conversations"  - for example we already heard at length and without censorship that Gordana Jankulovska and Zoran Stavrevski have new glasses; and what is "gossip" - we also heard at length and without censorship that other political figures are "crazy, bastards, criminals" etc.</p>
<p><strong>Update 31.3.2015</strong></p>
<p>Bombshell 14 was released on March 26 and it included an alleged conversation between Transport and communications minister Mile Jakanievski and his wife. The conversation remains published <a href="http://novatv.mk/index.php?navig=8&amp;cat=18&amp;vest=21211">online</a> (and elsewhere) despite it being a private conversation, where a concerned woman asks for the wellbeing of the man who is working late.</p>
<p>There has been some commentary that the reason why this conversation is released is the fact that it contains racist statements by the minister regarding the representatives from a Chinese road building company. However, the previous 17 released conversations from this batch contain enough foul language so that anyone can get a clear idea of racist or any other abusive statements. </p>

<p>There is no way to digest what we heard in the past 2-3 hours, but the initial statement (from the beginning of the disclosure process) that there is no way to do this (mass scale surveillance and thus control without the telecom operators) remains true.</p>
<p>In the recordings we heard alleged conversations that Tmobile Macedonia CEO Zarko Lukovski and CTO Miroslav Jovanovik participated in bulling of employees to make them vote for the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party as well as tracking people by cell phone to determine where are they on election day.</p>

<p>The last recordings, from the alleged bulk recorded conversations, reveal minister Minister Janakievski calling <a href="http://www.t-mobile.mk/public/about-t-mobile-macedonia.nspx">TMobile director Irena Misheva</a> to cut service to a telephone owned by someone from the political opposition in the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Zaev already stated that the massive surveillance of cell phone conversation cannot be done without cooperation form the operators. There are reasons to suspect that the operators didn't comply with the Constitutional court order to cut the direct conduits that led to the Interior Ministry between 2011 and 2014. Hearing that any interruption of service can be done with a call from the government just adds another nail to the coffin of privacy in Macedonia</p>

<p>This follows already released tapes that allege police brutality. </p>
<p>The latest recordings released by the opposition contain 11 conversations alleged to be between Mr. Stavrevski and the Minister of Interior Mrs. Gordana Jankulovska discussing at length corruption among their colleagues, the dismal state of the economy and the nearly bankrupted budget of Macedonia.</p>
<p>All of it was denied at Mr. Stavrevski press-conference. </p>

The tapes reveal more abuse of power by the leading figures in the Macedonian government including the prime minister Nikola Gruevski. One of the tapes show money being redirected form the Agency for electronic communication (btw, that is the same agency that should serve as a watchdog for telecom operator to make sure that there is not any unlawful bridge of consumers privacy) to be used for movie-making.</p>
<p>The new files give a clearer picture of the dismal situation with Macedonian media and their close connections with the ruling people of the government. Government ministers are heard ordering news stories and media editors accepting the requests. </p>
<p>However, the biggest revelation are the journalists' files. Over 100 journalists, including the late <a href="../../node/746.html">Nikola Mladenov</a>, have been targeted for periods longer than any legal time frame allowed under Macedonian law. Mr. Zaev said the files will be given to each of the journalists that were under surveillance. </p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>Following the 2pm press conference of opposition leader Zoran Zaev, Macedonian prime minister takes the podium at a press conference at 3:45 pm. </p>
<p>He repeats most of the things that he already said in his original statement: that recordings are made by foreign intelligence agencies and that are fake/edited. Also he says that the video recordings leaked to Youtube of his meeting with Mr. Zaev are lawful and done after filed criminal charges. </p>
<p>Almost simultaneously with the press conference major pro-government news outlets report a sentencing of a man that plead guilty in the 'coup d'etat' case in which Mr. Zaev is one of the suspects too. Mr. Gruevski cites this information in his speech, says people have already admitted to the crimes of espionage against the state.</p>
<p>Then the PM goes on to talk about new jobs, investments, roads and so on and that he says he will restore order.</p>

<p>The audio recordings provide the most shocking and most disturbing conversations between senior government officials and newspaper and TV editors so far. Aside from the language, the recordings reveal conspiracies, staged arrest, and plans for torture of political opponents and retaliation towards citizens who did not vote for the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party. Part of the audio is transcribed with analysis in Macedonian and published on <a href="http://okno.mk/node/44820">OKNO.mk</a>. </p>
<p>The recordings also reveal the close ties between Macedonia's leading news outlets and top ranking officials from the government, this time specifically with the chief of the secret police.</p>
<p>Over the past 5-6 years, Macedonia has fallen in media freedom rankings, only to go up 7 places from 123 on this year's <a href="http://index.rsf.org/">RSF rating</a>. The current media coverage of the leaks gives more proof to the point: only a handful of media outlets, most of which are on-line, provide information and analysis. The rest of about 25-30 TV and Radio stations, including the national broadcaster MRT, and newspapers remain in line with the government story that the recordings distributed to the public by the opposition party are montages made by hostile foreign government intelligence agencies made to destabilize the country.</p>

<p>However, as NovaTV already established (<a href="http://novatv.mk/index.php?navig=8&amp;cat=2&amp;vest=20159">link</a> also in Macedonian), at least one of the recorded, and now made public, conversations took place in 2011. At that time the law that was in use didn't even have 175 articles. </p>
<p>In fact, the Law on electronic communications which was in use up until February 2014 had an article 115 which clearly stated that telecom operators must keep a permanent record of any lawful interception taking place and that they must protect this information as a secret according to law. However, for a short period of 6 months - from  <a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/06/16/macedonia-introduces.html">June 2010</a> to December 2010, when the Constitutional court stroke it down, that article was amended in a way that allowed unsupervised wiretapping. </p>
<p>Mr. Zaev so far claimed that at least two people have been wiretapped four years or more - himself, and Dragan Pavlovikj - Latas - a prominent pro-government TV editor. If this is true then the telecom operators must have records dating back to 2010 according to article 115 of the law as described above, or at least, to have the knowledge that lawful wiretapping took place. Claiming that they couldn't know anything is at least misinterpretation of the facts.</p>
<p>The law was completely rewritten and passed in February 2014 and this obligation was removed in the new text (<a href="http://www.pravo.org.mk/documentlaws.php?name=електронски+комуникации">link</a> to ALL laws on electronic communications - in Macedonian). </p>
<p><em>This article was updated to correct the dates of the laws.</em></p>

<p>There was no other live media coverage which gives you a sense of the type of country Macedonia has became under the rule of Mr. Nikola Gruevski's government. Macedonia has plummeted at 123 place on media freedom rankings.</p>
<p>Mr. Zaev claims that a whistleblower form Macedonia's secret police have provided recordings that prove that about 20.000 people including cabinet members and aides of Mr. Gruevski, businessmen, NGOs, Macedonian Academy of science and arts and judges. Part of the recordings were played at the press conference.</p>
<p>TV Telma, a local news outlet, reported that mobile phone operators have participated in the mass surveillance.</p>

<p><em>Note: This article was corrected. The correct number stated by Mr. Zaev was 20.000 not 26.000.</em></p>
<p><em>Update: </em> An audio recording published by SDSM (youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyV-xZd-E-M">link</a>) contains 9 conversations: Mr. Zaev speaking with a reporter from Radio Free Europe, Mr. Zaev speaking with party colleague Mrs. Radmila Sekerinska, Mr. Zaev speaking  with his daughter, Interior minister Mrs. Gordana Jankulovska speaking with Finance minister Mr. Zoran Stavrevski, Former PM Mr. Ljubco Georgievski speaking with an unknown person 2 times, DUI president Mr. Ali Ahmeti speaking with an unknown person, DPA president Mr. Menduh Tachi speaking with an unknown person and NDP president Mr. Rufi Osmani speaking with an unknown person.</p>

<p>Both the PM Nikola Gruevski and the opposition leader Zoran Zaev claim that at the crux of the allegations are data gathered without warrant by intelligence agencies. The PM <a href="http://vmro-dpmne.org.mk/?p=25668">claims</a> that these data are provided to Mr. Zaev the by a foreign agency, that they mostly target Government officials, and that some of them are not genuine. The opposition leader <a href="http://sdsm.org.mk/default.aspx?articleId=11663&amp;mId=55&amp;agId=6">claims</a> that the data target thousands of ordinary citizens, and are leaked to Mr. Zaev's party by a whistleblower from within the Macedonian agencies that conducted the surveillance. (Both link are to statements which are in Macedonian.)</p>
<p>As we wait to learn the truth, here is what we know:</p>
<p>1. A government led by VMRO-DPMNE in 2001 was accused of warrantless surveillance in 2001. News articles in Macedonian from that period are available on <a href="http://www.time.mk/cw/1178c78420/trajkovski-nemam-vreme-da-mislam-na-prislusuvanjeto.html">Time.mk</a>.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2013/04/for-their-eyes-only-2/">According</a> to Citizen Lab there is a FinFisher Command &amp; Control server in Macedonia since 2013. There has been no denial of this report by any Government institution so far. </p>
<p>3. <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/06/18/nsa-surveillance-secret-cable-partners-revealed-rampart-a/">According to reports</a> based on Snowden's leaks, Macedonia is an European partner country for the NSA surveillance dragnet. Mr. Gruevski has a <a href="../../node/763.html">statement on record</a> that he does not know anything about the agreement between his administration and the US Government.</p>
<p>4. So far there have not been any reports that there is a third foreign government with the ability or capacity to carry out large scale surveillance in Macedonia.</p>
<p>If the above reports are true, then is possible to imagine that the Macedonian Government used Gamma's and NSA's technology to spy on it's citizens, and that someone from the government agencies thought that they went too far - which would make Mr. Zaev story plausible.</p>
<p>It is also possible and less controversial to imagine that the US Government spied on Macedonian government officials (like they spied German Chancellor Merkel). However, in that case it would be very difficult to imagine what did they hear that they thought it is important to be shared with the opposition party.</p>
<p>In any event the ongoing nondisclosure of said data raises much more questions. We don't know, for example, why the opposition party is holding the data for more than 3 months, or why they didn't opt for a Snowden/Wikileaks solution - sharing the data with a trusted media organization, that needn't be Macedonian, to publish the information for most impact.</p>

<p>Sometime around 12:30 the major mobile network in Macedonia - T-mobile went down. Many people reported problems with the other mobile networks too. I didn't have access to service for almost 3 hours. The outage was city-wide. </p>
<p>T-mobile said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileMK/status/542678659598155776">statement</a> that they had a short disruption of services due to technical difficulties. Their statement is - at least - questionable.</p>
<p>Whatever the true reason for lack of service, the fact is that all of the mobile operators had problems during the protest and service was swiftly restored sometime after 15 hours local time. </p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine a "technical difficulty" that would disable three networks at the same time and for the same period of hours. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the denial of service was planned to ensure that no live information was published on-line so that the media can be controlled to the extent that is possible. </p>
<p>This is what censorship looks like.</p>

<p>They all write about suspicions procurement of equipment. Unfortunately they all assign different properties and usage to the same equipment.</p>
<p>It all begins with a news report on NovaTV. The first part of the news story is OK. The public is being informed about a criminal complaint filed for some equipment that that is allegedly missing from th Faculty of security in Skopje, a subsidiary of UKLO - Bitola.</p>
<p>In the news report on NovaTV professor Frosina Remenski describes the missing equipment: an electronic microscope, AFIS system and digital communication surveillance technology. <a href="node/816.html">The AFIS  system was bought through the tender No. 43/2010</a>. The other two were procured in different procedures: No. 33/2010 for the electronic microscope and No. 40/2010 for the digital communication surveillance technology.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oe47T_FYhBE/VSuTfebVRoI/AAAAAAAAGoI/kuEeyLdhQSo/s640/1*jni5h-fn1kk-Jx93GeQuFw.jpeg" height="477" width="640" /><br /><em>source— e-nabavki.gov.mk</em></p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AyU-CxnVh-M/VSuTeZQ7gBI/AAAAAAAAGoE/aZZ4XUIR_-4/s640/1*6X5IVTlXJnpSyfUIsGYaLg.jpeg" height="480" width="640" /><br /><em>source— e-nabavki.gov.mk</em></p>
<p>At the moment when the alarm is sounded at UKLO the description of the equipment is known by one professor and probably an expert too, representatives from Transparency International and journalists. Yet, the alarm does not include danger from illegal production of biometric documents.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2TjLxNZmgP4/VSuTeQI3x0I/AAAAAAAAGoA/WE3YRxakKw4/s640/1*70lJNw8Ql4LJ_jRWBKlffA.jpeg" height="385" width="640" /><br /><em>source— novatv.mk</em></p>
<p>However, already in the second story published by NovaTV there are speculation about equipment procured for the state television MRT. It is a speculation because the evidence offered for that procurement is "An announcement for contract for tender“ “ (<a href="http://novatv.mk/newsimages/edit/dokument%20%281%29.jpg">screenshot</a> from NovaTV page) clearly and unambiguously says that the procured part is just one laboratory from the tender which is divisible i.e. has different and unrelated parts as far as the bidding and buying goes. When one reads what NovaTV writes: — „Ministry of educatoin was buying crime and forensic labs for the Macedonian radio-television."-one gets the impression that NovaTV did not click on the tender documentation where it is stated that the parts of the tender planned for MRT are a studio and a audio-video lab.</p>
<p>After this the story is taken on by Bure Vesnik. In theirs research they too speak of the missing UKLO equipment and suspicious procurement practices. They provide screenshots from the Macedonian official gazette containing detail list of the equipment.</p>
<p>This time, however, even we can clearly read what is the equipment, the news report insists that this is a surveillance equipment. A quick Google search will easily dispute that: an electronic microscope (33/2010) is a microscope, Morpho's AFIS is a forensic database (43/2010) and <a href="http://www.digitalintelligence.com/products/fredl/">FRED</a> is a mobile forensic station (40/2010) —probably something like the tools they show on CSI when they do a their work outside.</p>
<p>Finally, Fokus takes the story of the same equipment. Suspicious procurement practices, Universities, deans and the same equipment. It is the same equipment that a while ago was surveillance equipment. Now the AFIS system becomes something with which one can produce biometric passports and identity cards.</p>
<p>However, Fokus does the same mistake as NovaTV. Without checking the documentation for the 43/2010 tender -- where it is clear that one AFIS is being procured, they claim that three were bought and two of them are missing.</p>
<p><strong>For clarification: What is AFIS?</strong></p>
<p>We constantly read that there were three AFIS and that two are missing. Where are they? When I read this, and before I knew that AFIS is an acronym for Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems, I had the idea that we are talking about three devices -- let's say three printers -- and two of them are gone.</p>
<p>In fact, AFIS plenty of equipment. Only the one for which we are sure that was bought, according to the list from the official gazette, has (if I counted correctly) 104 pieces of individual equipment including tables, chairs and cabinets.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-15KKga4EJpc/VSuTetqmLAI/AAAAAAAAGoQ/AX-G2UUqNCg/s640/1*L5VP4Zg04WBhqNQ1JAOTPA.jpeg" height="640" width="452" /><br /><em>source— burevesnik.org</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, the claim that two AFIS systems are missing seems very strange. In fact, if two are really missing, we are missing two whole rooms of equipment. I do not want to say that two rooms full of equipment can not be stolen. They can be, but at least there should be more to support that claim that a reference towards procurement documentation which looks like no one has read.</p>
<p><em>Conspiracy theory time</em></p>
<p>Like they say anything is possible. Laptops from the FRED purchase can be used for surveillance, which is true also for any ordinary laptop. Printers and cameras bought with the AFIS can be used for making biometric documents, which is true also for any printer and camera (Macedonian readers will remember the cheap cameras used at the Identity cards boots). It is possible that the whole documentation for the 43/2010 tender is fabricated and fake. And all of the other 200 university procurements for which Bure Vesnik claims that are surveillance equipment shopping may have fake documentation.</p>
<p>However, the journalists so far failed to offer any source that three AFIS systems were bought. As far as I know they failed to offer an analysis of what was sought, bought, delivered and installed with the tenders 20/2010, 25/201, 26/201 33/2010, 34/2010, 40/2010, 41/2010, 43/2010, for all labs for all public institutions</p>
<p>Anything is possible.</p>
<p>But we can only judge on what we can research and confirm.</p>

<p>„The journalist has an obligation to educate himself in public.“ —says Joseph Campbell in the series of interviews "The Power of Myth". I did the same today when I decided to find out something more about our passport affair. </p>
<p>First of all, the affair of the missing equipment  or an equipment which is controversial is not new. This equipment was the subject of an article published by <a href="http://novatv.mk/index.php?navig=8&amp;vest=6742&amp;cat=20">Nova TV in August 2013</a>. Still, it is very indicative that this "criminal equipment" (NovaTV) from 2013 became an equipment for which "it is known that it could have been used in the making of biometric documents-passports and ID cards" (Fokus No. 994) in 2014. </p>
<p>In fact, this is the unknown. If the equipment as Fokus claims is  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Automated_Fingerprint_Identification_System">AFIS</a>, the same as the one used by the American <a href="http://www.morpho.com/actualites-et-evenements/presse/morphotrak-chosen-as-biometric-provider-for-fbi-next-generation-identification-program">FBI</a>, that had been provided by the daughter of Safran —<a href="http://www.morpho.com/"> Morpho</a>, then this equipment can not be used for the making of biometric documents due to the fact that it is only a forensic equipment. </p>
<p>The procurement of this equipment is indisputable even with regards to the information published by Fokus (No. 994, page 13) where the document for handover between Safran and the Ministry for education and science is shown. That equipment is <a href="http://www.morpho.com/identification/criminal-identification/systemes-d-identification-biometrique-automatises/metamorpho/?lang=en">MetaMorpho</a>.</p>
<p>French Safran sells equipment for the making of <a href="http://www.morpho.com/IMG/pdf/morpho_IDdocuments_idealpass_4p_gb.pdf">passports</a> and <a href="http://www.morpho.com/e-documents/id-documents/products/id-cards-and-resident-cards/?lang=en">ID cards</a>, but there has never been  information from anyone that this equipment was purchased in Macedonia, nor that Macedonia is on the list of clients for biometric documents of this company.  As a reminder, Macedonia purchased passport equipment in 2003. That <a href="http://star.utrinski.com.mk/?pBroj=1896&amp;stID=44629&amp;pR=2">equipment</a> according to information from the past costs 23 million EUR. </p>
<p>I think that this dismisses the claims of a possible connection between the tenders of the Ministry of education and science and the the passport making equipment. </p>
<p>Still, we can do research of whether there was a purchase of 3 AFIS devices in Macedonia, because even a fingerprint verification equipment and the maintenance of the forensic databases should not be in any other property other than in the property of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (the alleged hand-overs of equipement among the Ministry of Education and Science, the University Saint Kliment Ohridski in Bitola and the Ministry of Internal Affairs aside). </p>
<p>For that purpose we can go back to the acceptance certificate (Fokus No. 994, page 13). If Safran really brought and mounted three sets of the equipment than this equipment should have three acceptance certificates-each for the three locations it was mounted on. Further on, Agreement no. EP 18–60/22 dated 26.09.2011 should be checked (it was made between the Ministry of Education and Science and Safran) and to look for information about the quantity and the type of equipment that was shipped. It would be logical to expect that Safran would ask for these documents to be accurate and authentic prior to signing them  because if the acceptance certificate proves one thing and the Agreement another, then the Ministry of Education and Science could ask at some point that this Agreement is fully realized. Safran would not allow that for sure.</p>
<p>But, if all this seems complicated, it is enough to see tender documentation no. 43/2010 that is available on the web site of the Public Procurement Office (no permalink could be found, but you can check it at  <a href="https://e-nabavki.gov.mk/">https://e-nabavki.gov.mk/</a>).</p>
<p>The purchased laboratories are 1 AFIS and 2 sets of studio equipment for the Macedonian Radio Television. </p>

<p>If I start plotting theories of conspiracy then I would say that maybe all of the equipment could be used to make fake passports. However it should be checked if the Macedonian Radio Television has a new studio and audio-visual equipment and whether this equipment was also bought by Safran. But, tender 43/2010  is divisible and according to the documentation only one part of it was purchased-AFIS:</p>

<p>Updated December 4th 2014: According to <a href="http://www.state.wv.us/admin/purchase/bids/FY2008/B_DPS0808_2.pdf">the information</a> provided for in the public procurement documents of 2007 in the state of West Virginia the procurement costs of the basic AFIS system of the same manufacture are  2.950.000 USD.</p>

<p>The procurement costs in Macedonia according to all sources are 152 million MKD or round 2.5 million EUR. </p>

<p><a href="http://fokus.mk/tajna-fabrikka-za-rachna-izrabotka-na-pasoshi/">The news published by Fokus</a>  caused a lot of interest and therefore this additional information could be of use to the public debate.</p>
<p>Six photos are published on the newspaper’s website. Five of these photos are made between the 9th and the 10th of September 2014. This could be concluded from the metadata of the photos.  </p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hG51ywHNF60/VSuMRJVxMtI/AAAAAAAAGm4/PIIPy9MEX9c/s640/1*4x9O-NQNZ39FsUd8OpOLBw.jpeg" height="410" width="640" /></p>

<p>The sixth photograph is edited in Photoshop most probably by the editorial team of Fokus in order to hide the identity of the person.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OW9dCDLKvnw/VSuMRNiC3wI/AAAAAAAAGm8/fyVfcN5FOVQ/s640/1*GVEOmqh4fBpaasBPDSkLQQ.jpeg" height="410" width="640" /></p>
<p>According to the metadata the photos are taken with Samsung Galaxy S4 (GT-I9515), a phone which is on sale since <a href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/samsung-galaxy-s4-value-edition-1620">May 2014</a>. Even if it was bought immediately after its release for sale it could have not been used to take a photo of something related to the previous elections. (<a href="https://mk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8,_2014">The last elections</a> ended on April 27th 2014.)</p>

<p>Given the aforementioned and unless someone had already engaged in “playing” with the metadata of these photos ( which can be simply done in Photoshop as shown in photo no.6) these photos really are taken in September 2014 with a device not older than 6 months and one which is relatively expensive( more than 20.000,00 MKD, approximately 325 EUR retail price).</p>
<p><strong>Updated on 30.11.2014</strong>: In the printed edition of Fokus there is one more photo, one which shows some kind of a machine. This photo is not published on the web site. This photo shows several letters of the machine’s brand. The research in the brand database of WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) provides information about a brand that is very similar to the one shown on the photo. This brand is Original Perfecta, a brand owned by a company that produces paper cutting machines.</p>

<p>The brand was used by the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombinat_Polygraph_Werner_Lamberz">Werner Lamberz company from Leibzig, East Germany</a>, <a href="http://onlineweb.dkpto.dk/pvsonline/Varemaerke?action=109&amp;sagID=VA%201961%2001459">registered</a> for the Dannish jurisdiction in 1963.</p>
<p><strong>Uptade—FAQ:</strong></p>
<p>1.    Wasn’t Samsung Galaxy S4 available on the market since 2013? </p>
<p>There are two types of Galaxy S4 models. The first one was released in 2013. This is the GT-I9505 model.. (<a href="http://www.t-mobile.mk/public/detali-za-telefon.nspx?phoneid=14173&amp;tariff=592&amp;subscription=2&amp;duration=2&amp;installments=24">Link</a> to T-Mobile.mk website.) he second one is the Galaxy S4 Value Edition model GT-I9515 released for sale in May 2014 as provided for by the link in the text above.  </p>
<p>2. Is it possible that the photos are taken in September 2014 by photographing the video? </p>
<p>Focus published that it received both video and photos:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4jALQgrWVmk/VSuMTo6wg-I/AAAAAAAAGmo/1vapYoRaYb4/s400/1*yuJ8bQsPLp-75sB55bTTbg.jpeg" height="68" width="400" /></p>
<p>Without entering into discussion whether or not taking a photo of a video and getting good quality photos is an easy job, the video published by Fokus does not contain the same footages shown on the photos. This either means that Fokus did not receive the whole video material; the published material is not complete or the photos are taken independently. There are too many possibilities.</p>

The government appointed the members of the commission for mediation in the field of copyright and neighbouring rights. The capacity of the unit for copyright and neighbouring rights (part of the Ministry of Culture) remains insufficient. Cooperation among the institutions responsible for industrial property needs to improve.</p>
<p>The Law on <strong>industrial property rights</strong> was amended to regulate intellectual property rights, in accordance with the Strategy on Innovation. A system for electronic filing of patent applications became operational. In 2013, the Academy for Judges and Prosecutors delivered nine training programmes to 205 members of the judiciary on protection of intellectual property rights. The State Office for Industrial Property does not have sufficient staff to ensure a quality service vis-à-vis businesses and to support innovations. Training for small and medium-sized enterprises on protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights is limited.</p>
<p>As regards <strong>enforcement</strong>, the Coordination Body for Intellectual Property launched 16 actions in 2013 and seized approximately 2,000 counterfeit items. There were 24 criminal prosecutions and 11 charges for misdemeanours relating to intellectual property rights. The State Market Inspectorate carried out around 120 inspections. Only 1% of the fines imposed were collected in 2013. The Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services issued 18 banning orders to broadcasters to prevent further violations of copyright and neighbouring rights. Cooperation between the Ministry for the Interior and Interpol on uncovering regional counterfeit channels resulted in the seizure of 70000 counterfeit items, closure of a number of factories producing counterfeit goods and detention of 330 people. The overall number of controls and seizures is falling however, and commitment to combating violations of intellectual property rights is not improving. Counterfeit foodstuffs, cosmetics, toiletries, medicines, toys, technical and electronic equipment continued to be sold on stalls in streets markets and in outlets. Awareness of violations of intellectual property rights and of the threats to health and safety remains limited. Training for small and medium-sized enterprises on protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights is limited. The three public laboratories are not legally authorised to detect counterfeit medicines and their analyses are not accepted as expert evidence by the courts. Counterfeiting is not considered to be organised crime and efforts to combat it remain insufficient. Data on investigations, prosecutions and trials for offences relating to intellectual property rights have been collected systematically since 2013, but the State Statistical Office has not yet produced a reliable enforcement record.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>Some legislative progress was made in the area of intellectual property law. Enforcement efforts by all institutions continue, but the complexity of the enforcement system impedes  effective protection of intellectual property rights. A track record of investigations, prosecutions and trials for offences relating to intellectual property rights is not yet available and public awareness remains limited. Overall, preparations in this area are at a moderately advanced stage.</p>

Here is the latest. For the full text visit: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/countries/strategy-and-progress-report/">http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/countries/strategy-and-progress-report/</a></p>
<p><strong>4.7. Chapter 7: Intellectual property law</strong></p>
<p>The law on copyright and neighbouring rights is not aligned with the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Performances and Phonograms Treaty. The exclusion of phonogram rights and several disputes impeded the work of the two licensed collective rights management societies. The head of unit for copyright and neighbouring rights in the Ministry<br />
of Culture was dismissed, reducing the capacity of the unit, and co-operation between the unit and relevant institutions remains limited.</p>
<p>In the area of industrial property rights, WIPO’s electronic document management system was customised for the State Office for Industrial Property and linked with the automated court case management information system applied in all courts. In 2012, the Academy for Judges and Prosecutors trained 218 members of the judiciary on protection of intellectual property rights (IPR). In the area of industrial property rights, the country is on track.</p>
<p>As regards enforcement, a methodology for collecting data on was adopted; the improved statistics on IPR enforcement will be available from 2013 onwards. The Law on Customs Measures for the Protection of IPR was amended in May 2013 to introduce fines for counterfeit recidivism and to allow use of seized counterfeit clothing items for disaster<br />
recovery or social assistance packages. A user manual for the platform of the World Customs Organisation for IPR infringements was adopted, allowing recognition of originality of products. The Coordination Body for Intellectual Property undertook 25 coordinated actions in 2012, twice as many as in 2011; co-operation with the Agency for Managing Confiscated Property continued. In 2012, a total of 126 court proceedings were brought for violations of IPR. Courts imposed some 15 prison sentences and a number of fines for criminal offences on individuals. Counterfeit foodstuffs, cosmetics, hygiene products, medicines, toys, technical and electronic equipment are still widely available and awareness of their threats to health and safety is limited. Laboratory results confirming that medicines are counterfeit are not allowed as court evidence, which hampers the prosecution of counterfeiters. The IPR enforcement system remains complex rather than effective. Counterfeiting is not considered organised crime and efforts to combat it are insufficient. Co-operation at both national and international level has yet to be promoted. Preparations in this area are moderately advanced.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Some progress was made in the area of intellectual property law. A track record on investigation, prosecution and trial for IPR offences has been established. There are shortcomings in the procedures for prosecuting counterfeiters, with laboratory results on counterfeit medicines excluded as court evidence. There is no legal basis for collective management of phonogram rights. Awareness of IPR among institutions and the public remains low. Overall, preparations in the field of IPR are moderately advanced.</p>

Harald Schenker shared his insight on the local civil society:</p>
<p><cite>"Let’s now get to my favourite, the so-called civil society, some of them my friends and colleagues, others people I worked with, and others, finally, people I tried to work with. To all of them I have harsh words: civil engagement is not a job.</cite></p>
<p><cite>Civil engagement cannot be equated to euros. As long as Macedonia’s civil society sector continues merely to be a job-generating machine, you cannot expect social change, except for those working in the sector, of course.</cite></p>
<p><cite>The new, donor-driven bourgeoisie has installed itself comfortably and conformably in the centre of society, from where it aspires to more and learns to despise the have-nots, while not so secretly living in fear of being next to join those have-nots - if they are found too critical either of the power structures or the donors themselves. This is the material that kills social change."</cite></p>
<p>I've written in the past on the same <a href="../../node/669.html">subject</a>, although from a different point of view. Needless to say I agree with what Harald wrote. I think it would be a safe bet to say that most [all?] of the ex-YU countries have similar problems [or failures] of their civil society. A 2006 paper [dead link to pdf 'From the Civil sector to Civil society'] from Ismet Sejfija has some sharp commentary as well:</p>
<p><cite>"In Bosnia-Herzegovina, people working in civil society organisations who analyse developments in this sector often talk about “projectomania”. The term denotes an uncritical attitude by NGOs whose entire programme of activities revolves around project funding, and whose priority is to develop projects that focus on compliance with the sponsors’ criteria, often without considering their practical relevance and viability."</cite></p>
<p>The reason why I'm referencing all these writings is my stumble upon couple of new Macedonian NGO projects in the last week. The first is called "<a href="http://reagiram.mk/">I react</a>" and is a service for reporting municipal communal problems, and the second is called "<a href="http://sledigiparite.mk/">Follow the money</a>" and is a service for tracking municipal taxes and expenditures. Both caught my attention because I was already familiar with two other civil society projects that more-or-less provided the same services: "<a href="http://popravi.mk/">Repair it</a>" and "<a href="http://fiskalenmonitor.mk/">Fiscal monitor</a>". [It should be noted that the "react" people stated that their service had significant differences from "repair"]. </p>
<p>So, if my memory is not faulty, these two are not the only ones having doubles. And this is the research proposal: In the given pool of donors in the country, try to find out if they coordinate and collaborate on granting funds to civil society. Do they keep an eye on 'reinventing the wheel'? How many double projects are there so far and what is their success rate?</p>
<p>By the way, if you are reading this and decide to apply for a research grant, please leave a comment so someone else doesn't do the same thing and we end up with two reports. ;-)</p>

I gave a short introduction on the topic of availability of universities' research to the general public. </p>
<p>I borrowed a lot from elsewhere for the talk. First I used this memorable scene from Good Will Hunting to point out the importance of libraries for dissemination of knowledge. Of course, it is a scene that draws few laughs as well.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QnZ0Y4rvz6E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>
After that, using some of <a href="https://kiberkomunist.posterous.com/one-click-away">Marcell's ideas</a>, I talked about the importance of having a public library in the digital world. </p>
<p>Books, research, literature and other works, are available to the general public, at almost no marginal cost, via the public library. It is probably one of the most important institutions that were set up in the enlightenment era. Universities already make their work public. In Macedonia, lectures are open for the public, and all published material is cataloged in the national libraries. It is not perfect, but it works [for now]. We need to figure out how to preserve the library tradition on the Internet, and use the connectivity and storage to share further.</p>
<p>The event, by chance, took place at a school's library, which was nice. I thank YEF for the opportunity.</p>

It is as simple as that. </p>
<p>But here is the fine print: As far as public knowledge goes, most media in the country are already owned or controlled by the government or pro-government businessmen. If a story is not supposed to be run - it wont be, as we have seen on <a href="http://utrinski.com.mk/?ItemID=F4771BCB243D324EBE25AC090B759D49">numerous times so far</a>. Press freedom has <a href="https://rsf.org/en/world-press-freedom-index-2013">plummeted in recent years</a>. And, in the strangest turn of events [and as far as the official investigation goes without any foul play], <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/03/28/editor-of-macedonian-independent-newspaper-found-dead/">Nikola Mladenov died</a> and with him, the fate only independent or pro-opposition media outlet hangs by a thread.</p>
<p>So, by the time this law is enacted there might not be anything left to censor. Nevertheless, it is the murkiest of scenarios. There is little hope that the law can be halted in Parliament and even less in the Constitutional court which is postponing decisions on 'hot' issues. Journalists are divided on the issue of censorship and the profession at worst and scared for their job and paycheck at best. </p>
<p>Thus, another principled battle of huge proportion lands in the laps of couple of Internet activists, free speech groups and few journalists who, at least for now, ride on the free waves of the Internet. What [can we do] now?</p>

It seems that in the 2013 municipal elections the Twitter revolution finally happened in [to] Macedonia. </p>
<p>In the past few years there were couple of politically driven, socially charged issues [protest against police brutality, protest against rising electricity and heating prices] that used Internet, social networks and technology in general. However none of them were significantly successful. </p>
<p>Now finally <a href="http://www.okno.mk/node/27308">praise is coming from mainstream pundits</a>, and <a href="http://prntscr.com/zs2uc">acknowledgment and gratification</a> are coming from the mayor-elect of Centar municipality in Skopje. Twitter has won!</p>
<p>That is, of course, if we overlook the ongoing and extensive debate regarding the role of social networks in social movements - something that according to researches is <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/09/measuring-twitter-revolution-effect-pretty-hard/42878/">hard to measure</a>.  For more, there is always <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/07/facebook-twitter-revolutionaries-cyber-utopians">Evgeny Morozov's</a> writing criticizing the usual naivety of 'Tweets were sent. Dictators were toppled.'</p>
