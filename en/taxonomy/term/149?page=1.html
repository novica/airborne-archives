That was one of the key points of Radmila Sekerinska's speech at the meeting in Universal Hall on 10th March 2015. To quote:</p>
<p><cite>We do not seek support to change one Sasho or Nikola with another of the same type. We seek support to take responsibility and to change things.</cite></p>
<p>In this context the issue of authentic interpretation of the law for amnesty is a strange political move. SDSM is accusing Nikola Gruevski  for "false patriotism". Why? Is that a felony? More important, VMRO supporters almost  certainly will not hold this against Gruevski, because they are well trained to know that without the interpretation, SDSM would have regained power. The last is discussed in an <a href="../../../node/639.html">analysis</a> of clumsy and unprincipled PR activities of both parties in 2011. For whose benefit is the allegation of "false patriotism"? Does SDSM promise a new legal resolution for these cases, as they do for media freedom and law on communications? Have they reached an agreement about this with theirs expected coalition partner DUI?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is well known that the authentic interpretation is a political move and it is probable to expect that the same thing would have be done by any Macedonian government, including one that would include SDSM. There is a diplomatic cable published on Wikileaks where we can read that SDSM <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06SKOPJE152_a.html">calculated</a> with the cases before the elections in 2006. Quote:</p>
<p><cite>Prime Minister Buckovski told the EU Special Representative on February 10 that the government’s decision to ask for the cases “by the end of this year” was deliberately ambiguous. Ethnic Macedonians would understand that the cases finally were coming back for possible prosecution, answering past criticism that only ethnic Macedonians — such as former Interior Minister Boskovski, currently facing a war crimes trial in The Hague — had been called to account for their participation in the 2001 conflict. DUI would receive some satisfaction from the private knowledge that the first of the cases would probably not be returned until late 2006, and that the primary defendant in that case likely would be former NLA commander Daut Rexhepi (also known as Commander Leka), who is currently associated with rival ethnic Albanian party DPA.</cite></p>
<p>To refresh everybody's memory, the cases were send to ICTY by the broad coalition government <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/8069">just ten</a> days before the elections in 2002, and with that any work on the cases was delayed for at least four years. There is another cable on  Wikileaks where we can read that Gruevski was <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08SKOPJE607_a.html">not ambivalent </a> towards the fact that he inherited this issue. Quote:</p>
<p><cite>Gruevski replied that he understood the point, but he is in a delicate position politically. He would have no problem if the Chief Prosecutor or the courts ruled that the amnesty law indeed applies and the cases are dropped, but he believes he cannot take a stand on the issue other than to let the cases proceed. He is concerned that the main ethnic-Albanian parties, DPA and DUI, may soon introduce a measure asking parliament to take a stand on the issue. While he understood that his coalition deal with DUI could be on the line, he told us that he cannot go along with criticizing the prosecutions and then face the ethnic-Macedonian community, especially because the ICTY recently convicted ethnic-Macedonian former MoI official Johan Tarculovski of war crimes.</cite></p>
<p>At the end, the 'bombshel' completely favors DUI's leader Ali Ahmeti. If he is powerful enough to negotiate something like this (and he obviously was), then the Albanians will love him even more. This goes against the promises that the 'bombshells' will not spare anyone's crime, including the Albanian parties. Therefore there is not any logical explanation why SDSM is releasing these recordings...? What is the goal? Strengthening DUI?  Inter-ethnic turbulence?</p>
<p>In short, SDSM does not have a different principled or legal standing regarding the 'war crimes' cases, the release of the recordings will not trouble VMRO supporters since they already know that the amnesty is the lesser evil, and finally, it will not help the reconciliation of both communities.</p>
<p>Then there are the media. Prizma <a href="http://prizma.birn.eu.com/%D0%BC%D0%BA/%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B8/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0-%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%B0-%D1%85%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%B8-%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5-%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D0%BE-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B1%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8">writes</a>:</p>
<p><cite>The four cases were processed in ICTY, but in 2008 were returned to Macedonian courts.</cite></p>
<p>What does „processed“ mean? The US cable is more precise:</p>
<p><cite>ICTY agreed to review the cases in 2002, but the tribunal declined to prosecute — or even investigate — and returned the files to Macedonia.</cite></p>
<p>The journalists write that the conversation published by SDSM are 'alleged conversations between government ministers', but they do not write that the issue is 'alleged war crimes'. Unfortunately, those events are 'alleged' in the legal sense until a court decides otherwise. And since ICTY did not even undertake an investigation about these cases, who from the Macedonian political elite is going to be responsible for the delay? What if during the years when these cases were sitting in a bottom drawer in the Hague, in Macedonia someone was destroying related evidence?</p>
<p>But let's go back to the laws. The authentic interpretation most probably is irrelevant. If it is against international law (<a href="https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?mtdsg_no=IV-6&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en">UN Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes</a>  and other conventions ratified by Macedonia), and ratified conventions when ratified have priority over domestic law, then a future chief prosecutor may say that the authentic interpretation is void and reopen the cases. This kind of epilogue is possible. A new parliament can even vote on a different legal obligations. Do we have a promise that this will happen?</p>
<p>Moreover, the Macedonian justice system had an opportunity to work on one of these cases. What if they saw that there is nowhere to go? Public commentary, recommendations and request from organizations such as <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-macedonia-2013?page=show">Amnesty International</a>, are that there should be a court closure, but that does not mean that it will be with a *positive outcome for the victims*:</p>
<p><cite>Macedonia’s international obligations are to thoroughly and impartially investigate all cases returned from the ICTY and, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, to ensure that all those allegedly responsible for violations of international humanitarian law are brought to justice.</cite></p>
<p>So, when we already have (from the Wikileaks cable above) OSCE's expert opinion that from what they saw Macedonia  does not have enough evidence, nor good enough prosecutors and judges (despite plenty of training) to work on the cases:</p>
<p><cite>Additionally, OSCE has official observer status and has had the opportunity to review the files. Their experts here characterize the evidence they have seen as relatively scanty and the prosecutors and judges as apparently unprepared, despite being trained.</cite></p>
<p>and that Macedonian representatives from the government, specifically the chief prosecutor, said that there is not enough evidence:</p>
<p><em>Protoger added that the Chief Prosecutor told him that it appears that there is solid evidence against only four of the 19 defendants in the Mavrovo case, and Xhemaili is not one of them. (Which begs the question why the other 15 are being tried at all.)</em></p>
<p>then, is it not better for the whole society to forget about the cases and try heal the wounds, then to go to court, where the victims might lose, and their alleged torturers to claim judicial victory?</p>
<p>Think about this for a moment. What if there is a complete court process after which there will be a verdict that the indicted persons are not guilty? What effect will it have on the society? The easiest thing is to talk about not following the law and that Macedonia is ignoring international legal norms, but is there something else that in this particular case matters and should be taken into account? Is it even possible in an ethnically divided state where the minority continuously does not have trust in the judicial system, and the majority thinks that there should not be any protests regarding court decisions (like in the "Monstrum" case), to have a trial like the ones being pushed under the rug?</p>
<p>Furthermore, any such trial would have to happen in conditions, as heard in other leaked recordings presented by SDSM, where the "judiciary is corrupted and incompetent". How come that we expect courts to deal with complicated war cases, when they cannot deal with relatively easier corruption cases? Or, now that we know that the courts "belong to Mijalkov and the family", would we request that VMRO process the cases and ask for a "politically pleasant" verdicts?</p>
<p>What if the decision to have authentic interpretation, beside the political pragmatism to keep the coalition together, VMRO and Gruevski saved time, money, nerves and everything else that could have been costly for the victims' families? Did they offered reconciliation and showed forgiveness on behalf of ethnic Macedonians instead of opening old wounds? Did they created from the ethnic Macedonians  political winners willing to forgive instead of legal losers who will have new grievance? These are unpleasant questions to which the published content in the 'bombshell' offers no answer, and to which we will probably avoid to answer in the future as well.  </p>
<p>Maybe this 'bombshell' is just to encourage DUI, with the help of the US. Let's hope it will not create new inter-ethnic tensions.</p>

<p>Over the past few days Stojanche Angelov the president of the right wing party Dostoinstvo was trying to enter the state television and deliver the leaked recordings to the reporters who work there. According to  the editor at the state television they are not airing any of those recordings because they are following public prosecutor's instructions which by many are considered ill placed.</p>
<p>The visit of Mr. Angelov had a twist when the radio hosts of Kanal 103 (the independent music radio that airs from the state tv building) saw him in the hallway and invited him to come to their talk show. The private security that guards the building stopped Mr. Angelov and didn't allowed him to go to Kanal 103 studio.</p>
<p>Later that evening the security officers barged in Kanal 103 studio <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gocemitevski/upad-kanal103-13-03-2015">interrupting the program and demanding</a> that the person working provides a valid ID card before he can continue with the show.</p>
<p>Earlier that day we witnessed how the leading <a href="http://therealpsmst.tumblr.com/post/113509431103">opposition weekly Fokus</a> and the on-line outlet NovaTV changed the reporting on the latest leaks released on Thursday. One of the tapes there was an alleged conversation between chief of secret police Sasho Mijalkov and Sitel TV editor Dragan Pavlovikj where they discuss that then opposition leader and ex-president Branko Crvenkovski offered voters exchange on local elections between Karposh and Centar municipalities in Skopje.</p>
<p>NovaTV first published the whole recording, then removed and published again. According to its editor that was done to remove "<a href="https://twitter.com/BorjanJovanovsk/status/576373070484606976">private conversation (gossip)</a>". Almost simultaneously Focus changed its on-line reporting from "an official statement of SDSM's press person" to "unofficial sources from the party" that the recording was aired in full by mistake and that the staff at the party forgot to remove private conversations, including the part concerning Mr. Crvenkovski.</p>
<p>This, obviously, raises concerns that previous recordings are "cleaned up" to remove parts that could produce bad publicity for the opposition. At the same it becomes less clear how the opposition party and the media who are reporting on the recordings decide what are "private conversations"  - for example we already heard at length and without censorship that Gordana Jankulovska and Zoran Stavrevski have new glasses; and what is "gossip" - we also heard at length and without censorship that other political figures are "crazy, bastards, criminals" etc.</p>
<p><strong>Update 31.3.2015</strong></p>
<p>Bombshell 14 was released on March 26 and it included an alleged conversation between Transport and communications minister Mile Jakanievski and his wife. The conversation remains published <a href="http://novatv.mk/index.php?navig=8&amp;cat=18&amp;vest=21211">online</a> (and elsewhere) despite it being a private conversation, where a concerned woman asks for the wellbeing of the man who is working late.</p>
<p>There has been some commentary that the reason why this conversation is released is the fact that it contains racist statements by the minister regarding the representatives from a Chinese road building company. However, the previous 17 released conversations from this batch contain enough foul language so that anyone can get a clear idea of racist or any other abusive statements. </p>

<p>There is no way to digest what we heard in the past 2-3 hours, but the initial statement (from the beginning of the disclosure process) that there is no way to do this (mass scale surveillance and thus control without the telecom operators) remains true.</p>
<p>In the recordings we heard alleged conversations that Tmobile Macedonia CEO Zarko Lukovski and CTO Miroslav Jovanovik participated in bulling of employees to make them vote for the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party as well as tracking people by cell phone to determine where are they on election day.</p>

<p>The last recordings, from the alleged bulk recorded conversations, reveal minister Minister Janakievski calling <a href="http://www.t-mobile.mk/public/about-t-mobile-macedonia.nspx">TMobile director Irena Misheva</a> to cut service to a telephone owned by someone from the political opposition in the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Zaev already stated that the massive surveillance of cell phone conversation cannot be done without cooperation form the operators. There are reasons to suspect that the operators didn't comply with the Constitutional court order to cut the direct conduits that led to the Interior Ministry between 2011 and 2014. Hearing that any interruption of service can be done with a call from the government just adds another nail to the coffin of privacy in Macedonia</p>

<p>This follows already released tapes that allege police brutality. </p>
<p>The latest recordings released by the opposition contain 11 conversations alleged to be between Mr. Stavrevski and the Minister of Interior Mrs. Gordana Jankulovska discussing at length corruption among their colleagues, the dismal state of the economy and the nearly bankrupted budget of Macedonia.</p>
<p>All of it was denied at Mr. Stavrevski press-conference. </p>

The tapes reveal more abuse of power by the leading figures in the Macedonian government including the prime minister Nikola Gruevski. One of the tapes show money being redirected form the Agency for electronic communication (btw, that is the same agency that should serve as a watchdog for telecom operator to make sure that there is not any unlawful bridge of consumers privacy) to be used for movie-making.</p>
<p>The new files give a clearer picture of the dismal situation with Macedonian media and their close connections with the ruling people of the government. Government ministers are heard ordering news stories and media editors accepting the requests. </p>
<p>However, the biggest revelation are the journalists' files. Over 100 journalists, including the late <a href="../../../node/746.html">Nikola Mladenov</a>, have been targeted for periods longer than any legal time frame allowed under Macedonian law. Mr. Zaev said the files will be given to each of the journalists that were under surveillance. </p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>Following the 2pm press conference of opposition leader Zoran Zaev, Macedonian prime minister takes the podium at a press conference at 3:45 pm. </p>
<p>He repeats most of the things that he already said in his original statement: that recordings are made by foreign intelligence agencies and that are fake/edited. Also he says that the video recordings leaked to Youtube of his meeting with Mr. Zaev are lawful and done after filed criminal charges. </p>
<p>Almost simultaneously with the press conference major pro-government news outlets report a sentencing of a man that plead guilty in the 'coup d'etat' case in which Mr. Zaev is one of the suspects too. Mr. Gruevski cites this information in his speech, says people have already admitted to the crimes of espionage against the state.</p>
<p>Then the PM goes on to talk about new jobs, investments, roads and so on and that he says he will restore order.</p>

<p>The audio recordings provide the most shocking and most disturbing conversations between senior government officials and newspaper and TV editors so far. Aside from the language, the recordings reveal conspiracies, staged arrest, and plans for torture of political opponents and retaliation towards citizens who did not vote for the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party. Part of the audio is transcribed with analysis in Macedonian and published on <a href="http://okno.mk/node/44820">OKNO.mk</a>. </p>
<p>The recordings also reveal the close ties between Macedonia's leading news outlets and top ranking officials from the government, this time specifically with the chief of the secret police.</p>
<p>Over the past 5-6 years, Macedonia has fallen in media freedom rankings, only to go up 7 places from 123 on this year's <a href="http://index.rsf.org/">RSF rating</a>. The current media coverage of the leaks gives more proof to the point: only a handful of media outlets, most of which are on-line, provide information and analysis. The rest of about 25-30 TV and Radio stations, including the national broadcaster MRT, and newspapers remain in line with the government story that the recordings distributed to the public by the opposition party are montages made by hostile foreign government intelligence agencies made to destabilize the country.</p>

<p>However, as NovaTV already established (<a href="http://novatv.mk/index.php?navig=8&amp;cat=2&amp;vest=20159">link</a> also in Macedonian), at least one of the recorded, and now made public, conversations took place in 2011. At that time the law that was in use didn't even have 175 articles. </p>
<p>In fact, the Law on electronic communications which was in use up until February 2014 had an article 115 which clearly stated that telecom operators must keep a permanent record of any lawful interception taking place and that they must protect this information as a secret according to law. However, for a short period of 6 months - from  <a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/06/16/macedonia-introduces.html">June 2010</a> to December 2010, when the Constitutional court stroke it down, that article was amended in a way that allowed unsupervised wiretapping. </p>
<p>Mr. Zaev so far claimed that at least two people have been wiretapped four years or more - himself, and Dragan Pavlovikj - Latas - a prominent pro-government TV editor. If this is true then the telecom operators must have records dating back to 2010 according to article 115 of the law as described above, or at least, to have the knowledge that lawful wiretapping took place. Claiming that they couldn't know anything is at least misinterpretation of the facts.</p>
<p>The law was completely rewritten and passed in February 2014 and this obligation was removed in the new text (<a href="http://www.pravo.org.mk/documentlaws.php?name=електронски+комуникации">link</a> to ALL laws on electronic communications - in Macedonian). </p>
<p><em>This article was updated to correct the dates of the laws.</em></p>

<p>There was no other live media coverage which gives you a sense of the type of country Macedonia has became under the rule of Mr. Nikola Gruevski's government. Macedonia has plummeted at 123 place on media freedom rankings.</p>
<p>Mr. Zaev claims that a whistleblower form Macedonia's secret police have provided recordings that prove that about 20.000 people including cabinet members and aides of Mr. Gruevski, businessmen, NGOs, Macedonian Academy of science and arts and judges. Part of the recordings were played at the press conference.</p>
<p>TV Telma, a local news outlet, reported that mobile phone operators have participated in the mass surveillance.</p>
<p>Tweeting live in English from the press conference was <a href="https://twitter.com/tanjatania">@tanjatania</a>.</p>
<p>Related:  <a href="../../../node/768.html">Surveillance and abuse of power - Macedonian chapter</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: This article was corrected. The correct number stated by Mr. Zaev was 20.000 not 26.000.</em></p>
<p><em>Update: </em> An audio recording published by SDSM (youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyV-xZd-E-M">link</a>) contains 9 conversations: Mr. Zaev speaking with a reporter from Radio Free Europe, Mr. Zaev speaking with party colleague Mrs. Radmila Sekerinska, Mr. Zaev speaking  with his daughter, Interior minister Mrs. Gordana Jankulovska speaking with Finance minister Mr. Zoran Stavrevski, Former PM Mr. Ljubco Georgievski speaking with an unknown person 2 times, DUI president Mr. Ali Ahmeti speaking with an unknown person, DPA president Mr. Menduh Tachi speaking with an unknown person and NDP president Mr. Rufi Osmani speaking with an unknown person.</p>

<p>Both the PM Nikola Gruevski and the opposition leader Zoran Zaev claim that at the crux of the allegations are data gathered without warrant by intelligence agencies. The PM <a href="http://vmro-dpmne.org.mk/?p=25668">claims</a> that these data are provided to Mr. Zaev the by a foreign agency, that they mostly target Government officials, and that some of them are not genuine. The opposition leader <a href="http://sdsm.org.mk/default.aspx?articleId=11663&amp;mId=55&amp;agId=6">claims</a> that the data target thousands of ordinary citizens, and are leaked to Mr. Zaev's party by a whistleblower from within the Macedonian agencies that conducted the surveillance. (Both link are to statements which are in Macedonian.)</p>
<p>As we wait to learn the truth, here is what we know:</p>
<p>1. A government led by VMRO-DPMNE in 2001 was accused of warrantless surveillance in 2001. News articles in Macedonian from that period are available on <a href="http://www.time.mk/cw/1178c78420/trajkovski-nemam-vreme-da-mislam-na-prislusuvanjeto.html">Time.mk</a>.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://citizenlab.org/2013/04/for-their-eyes-only-2/">According</a> to Citizen Lab there is a FinFisher Command &amp; Control server in Macedonia since 2013. There has been no denial of this report by any Government institution so far. </p>
<p>3. <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/06/18/nsa-surveillance-secret-cable-partners-revealed-rampart-a/">According to reports</a> based on Snowden's leaks, Macedonia is an European partner country for the NSA surveillance dragnet. Mr. Gruevski has a <a href="../../../node/763.html">statement on record</a> that he does not know anything about the agreement between his administration and the US Government.</p>
<p>4. So far there have not been any reports that there is a third foreign government with the ability or capacity to carry out large scale surveillance in Macedonia.</p>
<p>If the above reports are true, then is possible to imagine that the Macedonian Government used Gamma's and NSA's technology to spy on it's citizens, and that someone from the government agencies thought that they went too far - which would make Mr. Zaev story plausible.</p>
<p>It is also possible and less controversial to imagine that the US Government spied on Macedonian government officials (like they spied German Chancellor Merkel). However, in that case it would be very difficult to imagine what did they hear that they thought it is important to be shared with the opposition party.</p>
<p>In any event the ongoing nondisclosure of said data raises much more questions. We don't know, for example, why the opposition party is holding the data for more than 3 months, or why they didn't opt for a Snowden/Wikileaks solution - sharing the data with a trusted media organization, that needn't be Macedonian, to publish the information for most impact.</p>
