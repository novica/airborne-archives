It seems that in the 2013 municipal elections the Twitter revolution finally happened in [to] Macedonia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years there were couple of politically driven, socially charged issues [protest against police brutality, protest against rising electricity and heating prices] that used Internet, social networks and technology in general. However none of them were significantly successful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now finally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okno.mk/node/27308&quot;&gt;praise is coming from mainstream pundits&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://prntscr.com/zs2uc&quot;&gt;acknowledgment and gratification&lt;/a&gt; are coming from the mayor-elect of Centar municipality in Skopje. Twitter has won!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, of course, if we overlook the ongoing and extensive debate regarding the role of social networks in social movements - something that according to researches is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/09/measuring-twitter-revolution-effect-pretty-hard/42878/&quot;&gt;hard to measure&lt;/a&gt;.

 <description>&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-1 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mk/taxonomy/term/5&quot;&gt;македонија&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mk/taxonomy/term/43&quot;&gt;авторски права&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mk/taxonomy/term/41&quot;&gt;политика&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mk/taxonomy/term/114&quot;&gt;english&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Стана обичај на блогов да го закачувам делот од извештајот на ЕК за Македонија што се однесува на авторски права. Па еве го и за 2012 година.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.7. Chapter 7: Intellectual property law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some progress was made in the area of copyright and neighbouring rights. The amount of single equitable remuneration for reproduction for private use of written works, phonograms and videograms was regulated; the compliance with the acquis remains to be confirmed. The commission for mediation in the field of copyright and neighbouring rights is now the institution responsible to provide opinion on the tariff schemes of the collective rights management (CRM) societies that are to obtain licences. Two CRM societies are currently active. The cooperation of the unit responsible for copyright in the Ministry of Culture with the relevant institutions was limited. In this area, the country is advanced. Further progress was made in the area of industrial property rights. The London Agreement on the application of Article 65 of the European Patent Convention that aims at reducing the costs for patent translation was ratified. A license regime for chartered valuators in the area of industrial property was set up. Implementing legislation on registration of designation of origin and geographical indications of agricultural products was adopted. The State Office for Industrial Property (SOIP) continued the cooperation with the World Intellectual Property Organization, European Patent Office, European Patent Academy and other relevant bodies. Trainings and public  wareness raising activities related to intellectual property rights (IPR) continued. In 2011, Academy for Judges and Prosecutors delivered 16 trainings on protection of IPR, including training of trainers, to 328 members of the judiciary as part of the continuous training. The National Strategy for intellectual property has yet to be updated. In the area of industrial property rights, the country remains well advanced.&lt;br /&gt;
Some progress can be reported as regards enforcement. The Law on customs measures for protection of IPR was amended to allow for processing of requests for such measures free of charge. The 2011-2013 Strategy for customs measures for protection of IPR was adopted. The increased competencies of the State Market Inspectorate (SMI) when seizing counterfeit items have had a positive impact. 49 police inspectors from the Ministry of Interior (MoI) deal with infringements of IPR. The Bureau on Pharmaceuticals (BP) seized counterfeit life-style medicines that were being sold in pharmacies, but there is no awareness as regards the threats posed by counterfeit medicines to the health and safety of the consumers. The Coordination Body for Intellectual Property (CBIP) undertook 12 coordinated actions in 2011, which is a drop by half compared to 2010. Cooperation of the CBIP with the Agency for Managing Confiscated Property continued, but the number of goods publicly destroyed decreased significantly in 2011. Competencies for IPR are spread across many law enforcement institutions (CBIP, SMI, MoI, BP, Customs administration, Ministry of Justice etc.) which creates a complex, rather than effective system IPR protection. In 2011, a total of 126 court procedures were initiated for violations of IPR. About 15 prison sentences and a number of fines on criminal offences were issued to individuals by the specialised IPR departments of the courts. Development of a methodology for collecting and exchanging statistical data on IPR is at an early stage; however the exchange of data between the law enforcement institutions is not systematic. Awareness that counterfeit affects also foodstuffs, cosmetics, hygiene products, medicines, toys, technical and electronic equipment is low and such goods are being sold in the streets and green markets. The trade in counterfeit medicines and fake products via the internet is still not subject of criminal prosecution. The cooperation between authorities to trace counterfeit channels and tackle the ‘counterfeit pyramid’ is limited, both at national and international level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some progress was made in the area of intellectual property regarding both the legislative framework and administrative capacity. Implementation remains a challenge and the collective rights management system is still underdeveloped. A solid track record on investigation, prosecution and trial of IPR-related cases has yet to be established, as violations of IPR continue. The level of awareness of IPR among the institutions and public remains low. Overall, preparations in the field of IPR are moderately advanced.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-1 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mk/taxonomy/term/5&quot;&gt;македонија&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mk/taxonomy/term/43&quot;&gt;авторски права&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mk/taxonomy/term/113&quot;&gt;еу&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mk/taxonomy/term/114&quot;&gt;english&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 7: Intellectual property law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some development in the area of &lt;strong&gt;copyright and neighbouring rights&lt;/strong&gt;. The Law on copyright and neighbouring rights improved the framework for the licensing of collective rights management (CRM) societies and set a deadline of September 2011 for renewal of the old licences. Alignment of the law with EU acquis remains to be confirmed. However, the CRM societies remain inactive and/or are still to obtain their licences under the new Law on copyright. The administrative capacity of the unit responsible for copyright in the Ministry of Culture remains weak. In the area of copyright and neighbouring rights, the country is moderately advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good progress was made in the area of &lt;strong&gt;industrial property rights&lt;/strong&gt;. The Law on industrial property was amended to better protect the geographical names of agricultural products and to increase the competences of the State Market Inspectorate (SMI) when seizing counterfeit items. Furthermore, the Law on ratification of the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration was adopted. The State Office for Industrial Property (SOIP) signed a 2010-2012 action plan for cooperation with the European Patent Organization. Some management staff of the SOIP resigned; however, a total of 33 staff is sufficient. Activities to raise awareness of intellectual property rights (IPR) continued. Under the TEMPUS programme, the Centre for Intellectual Property Education launched the first specialised master studies on IPR starting with the 2010-2011 academic year. As part of the curriculum for continuous training of the Academy for Judges and Prosecutors, 405 members of the judiciary were trained on IPR in 2010. In the area of industrial property rights, the country remains well advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress can be reported as regards &lt;strong&gt;enforcement&lt;/strong&gt;. The Coordination Body for Intellectual Property (CBIP) in 2010 undertook 23 coordinated actions throughout the country to combat piracy and counterfeiting. The CBIP continued to seize counterfeit goods, mainly audio/video CDs, clothing, cigarettes and alcohol, but also toys, software and broadcasting equipment. Cooperation with the Agency for Managing Confiscated Property continued and about 180,000 goods that were the subject of a court decision were publicly destroyed in 2010. The distribution of competences between the law enforcement institutions (SMI, the Customs administration and the Ministry of Interior) remains unclear. Seizure of counterfeit pharmaceutical products started in cooperation with the Bureau on pharmaceuticals, but consumers&#039; awareness of their health risks and threats to their safety remains limited. The number of misdemeanour, civil and criminal proceedings increased; 91 out of 152 cases dealt with by the specialised IPR departments of the 13 basic courts were completed in 2010. 34 fines of between €200 and €1,600 were imposed on legal entities, and 10 individuals were sentenced to 6 months&#039; imprisonment. However, counterfeit products continued to be sold on temporary stalls in the streets, markets and outlets. The trade in counterfeit medicines and fake products via the internet is not subject to criminal prosecution. There is still no reliable enforcement record. A methodology for collecting statistical data has yet to be developed. A system for exchanging data between the law enforcement institutions has yet to be established. Counterfeit channels remain untraced and little was done to tackle the &#039;counterfeit pyramid&#039;. A central body is needed in order to bring together the various institutions and authorities involved in enforcement related activities and to fully assess the current situation and develop a national strategy and action plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some progress was made in terms of the IPR legal framework. The framework for the licensing of collective rights management societies was improved. The powers of the State Market Inspectorate when seizing counterfeit items were increased. Law enforcement institutions continue to cooperate, but their respective responsibilities with regard to enforcement of intellectual property rights remain unclear. Although the actions of the CBIP continued on a regular basis, counterfeiting and piracy remains widespread. The track record on investigation, prosecution and judicial handling of piracy and counterfeit is not satisfactory. Counterfeit and piracy are not addressed as an aspect of organised crime. The level of awareness of intellectual property rights among the public remains low. Overall, preparations in the area of Intellectual property law are advancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Charter for Democracy&lt;/strong&gt; (стр. 146)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the fall of the Soviet Union democracy has spread rapidly across the developing world. Political scientists actually measure it. There is an index called Polity that rates the degree of democracy on a scale from 0 to 10. In the 1980s the average developing county scored only around 2; now the average is around 4.5. However, to date, this transition to democracy has been deﬁned overwhelmingly in terms of elections. This has been inevitable. Electoral competition can be introduced with great speed even in the most unpromising bottom-billion conditions, such as Afghanistan. As the prospect of elections moves toward becoming a reality, many individuals and groups have incentives to behave in ways that facilitate their introduction: they form political parties as a means to acquiring power. But remember, elections are not enough. Electoral competition can make things worse, because patronage will often win out over honest politics in the struggle for votes—recall the survival of the fattest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, checks and balances take time to introduce, and they are political orphans: those parties that expect to rule have a direct interest in frustrating their introduction, and the entire political class stands to lose if patronage politics is made infeasible. Elections determine who is in power, but they do not determine how power is used. Because of the different time scales for elections and for checks and balances, the instant democracies must almost inevitably go through a phase in which electoral competition faces few restraints. The real issue is whether this is merely a phase or becomes a permanent feature of the polity—whether these countries get stuck with a parody of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;links inline&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;en first last&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/node/592&quot; class=&quot;language-link&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-1 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mk/taxonomy/term/5&quot;&gt;македонија&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mk/taxonomy/term/43&quot;&gt;авторски права&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mk/taxonomy/term/113&quot;&gt;еу&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mk/taxonomy/term/114&quot;&gt;english&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.7. Chapter 7: Intellectual property law&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some progress has been made on &lt;strong&gt;copyright and neighbouring rights&lt;/strong&gt;. A new Law on&lt;br /&gt;
copyright and neighbouring rights was enacted with an aim to reach alignment with the&lt;br /&gt;
Enforcement Directive. Following best international practice, copyright royalties will be&lt;br /&gt;
calculated on the basis of the income instead of the profit. The website of the Ministry of&lt;br /&gt;
Culture on copyright protection is now regularly updated. The decisions of the Ministry of&lt;br /&gt;
Culture to suspend the activities of two of the three collective rights management (CRM)&lt;br /&gt;
societies were annulled following a decision of the Administrative Court. However, the&lt;br /&gt;
Ministry of Culture did not reinstate these two CRM societies’ licences. Only the Association&lt;br /&gt;
for Protection of Copyright on Musical Works (ZAMP) is currently active. The unit&lt;br /&gt;
responsible for copyright in the Ministry of Culture remains understaffed, with only four&lt;br /&gt;
employees. In the area of copyright and neighbouring rights the country is moderately&lt;br /&gt;
advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further progress has been made in the area of &lt;strong&gt;industrial property rights&lt;/strong&gt;. The Criminal Code was amended to better define intellectual property rights (IPR) infringements and to increase the maximum prison term to five years. The country ratified the Patent Law Treaty, the&lt;br /&gt;
Vienna Agreement for establishing an international classification of the figurative elements of&lt;br /&gt;
marks, the Singapore Treaty on the law on trademarks, the Lisbon Agreement for the&lt;br /&gt;
protection of appellations of origin and their international registration, and the Protocol&lt;br /&gt;
amending the Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property (TRIPS). The&lt;br /&gt;
staffing of the State Office for Industrial Property (SOIP) remains sufficient even though it&lt;br /&gt;
has decreased from 34 to 32 in 2010. Activities to raise awareness of IPR issues were held in&lt;br /&gt;
cooperation with the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), the European Patent&lt;br /&gt;
Office, the European Patent Academy, the Skopje Law Faculty, and the Academy for training&lt;br /&gt;
of judges and prosecutors. In the area of industrial property rights the country is well&lt;br /&gt;
advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some progress can be reported as regards &lt;strong&gt;enforcement&lt;/strong&gt;. The national strategy for intellectual property is being implemented. The Coordination Body for Intellectual Property (CBIP)&lt;br /&gt;
adopted its operational programme for combating piracy and counterfeiting. The CBIP&lt;br /&gt;
continued to take regular action throughout the country and seized about 130,000 counterfeit&lt;br /&gt;
products and closed 10 outlets in 2009. Information about the activities of the CBIP is&lt;br /&gt;
published monthly. Goods seized were mainly counterfeit audio/video CDs, clothing,&lt;br /&gt;
cigarettes and alcohol. Those goods that were the subject of a court decision were forwarded&lt;br /&gt;
to the Agency for Managing Confiscated Property and publicly destroyed. A group of&lt;br /&gt;
customs officers was trained to specifically deal with combating counterfeiting and piracy.&lt;br /&gt;
State market inspectors received training to recognise counterfeit products. However, the&lt;br /&gt;
division of competences between the law enforcement institutions is not clear. Awareness of&lt;br /&gt;
the health and safety risks of counterfeit pharmaceutical products is limited. A reliable&lt;br /&gt;
enforcement record is still missing. A system for exchanging data between the law&lt;br /&gt;
enforcement institutions has yet to be established and the method for collecting statistical data&lt;br /&gt;
on enforcement is underdeveloped. Counterfeit channels are rarely traced and little was&lt;br /&gt;
undertaken to eradicate the top of the counterfeit pyramid. The number of misdemeanour,&lt;br /&gt;
civil and criminal proceedings remains unsatisfactory. Only 23 out of 98 cases dealt with by&lt;br /&gt;
the specialised IPR departments of the 13 basic courts were completed in 2009. Fines of up to&lt;br /&gt;
€ 1,000 were imposed on legal entities. Criminal and misdemeanour charges were pressed&lt;br /&gt;
against individuals, but the selling of counterfeit products on temporary stalls continued.&lt;br /&gt;
Cooperation with the Agency for Managing Confiscated Property has been established. As&lt;br /&gt;
regards enforcement, the country is moderately advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some progress has been made in terms of the IPR legal framework. A new Law on copyright&lt;br /&gt;
and neighbouring rights was enacted. Law enforcement institutions cooperate, but the division&lt;br /&gt;
of responsibilities over IPR enforcement is unclear. The CBIP took regular action; however,&lt;br /&gt;
counterfeiting and piracy remains widespread and fake products continue to be sold in the&lt;br /&gt;
main streets, markets and outlets. The track record on investigation, prosecution and judicial&lt;br /&gt;
handling of piracy and counterfeiting is not satisfactory. The level of awareness of intellectual&lt;br /&gt;
property rights among the public remains low.&lt;/p&gt;

На англиски е и малку е подолг, па нека простат тие на кои ова не им е згодно.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school was what could euphemistically be called a &quot;teaching college.&quot; At a teaching college you teach and you teach and you teach with no time for research, no time for contemplation, no time for participation in outside affairs. Just teach and teach and teach until your mind grows dull and your creativity vanishes and you become an automaton saying the same dull things over and over to endless waves of innocent students who cannot understand why you are so dull, lose respect and fan this disrespect out into the community. The reason you teach and you teach and you teach is that this is a very clever way of running a college on the cheap while giving a false appearance of genuine education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet despite this he called the school by a name that didn’t make much sense, in fact sounded a little ludicrous in view of its actual nature. But the name had great meaning to him, and he stuck to it and he felt, before he left, that he had rammed it into a few minds sufficiently hard to make it stick. He called it a &quot;Church of Reason,&quot; and much of the puzzlement people had about him could have ended if they’d understood what he meant by this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of Montana at this time was undergoing an outbreak of ultra-right-wing politics like that which occurred in Dallas, Texas, just prior to President Kennedy’s assassination. A nationally known professor from the University of Montana at Missoula was prohibited from speaking on campus on the grounds that it would &quot;stir up trouble.&quot; Professors were told that all public statements must be cleared through the college public-relations office before they could be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic standards were demolished. The legislature had previously prohibited the school from refusing entry to any student over twenty-one whether he had a high-school diploma or not. Now the legislature had passed a law fining the college eight thousand dollars for every student who failed, virtually an order to pass every student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly elected governor was trying to fire the college president for both personal and political reasons. The college president was not only a personal enemy, he was a Democrat, and the governor was no ordinary Republican. His campaign manager doubled as state coordinator for the John Birch Society. This was the same governor who supplied the list of fifty subversives we heard about a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as part of this vendetta, funds to the college were being cut. The college president had passed on an unusually large part of the cut to the English department, of which Phædrus was a member, and whose members had been quite vocal on issues of academic freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phædrus had given up, was exchanging letters with the Northwest Regional Accrediting Association to see if they could help prevent these violations of accreditation requirements. In addition to this private correspondence he had publicly called for an investigation of the entire school situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point some students in one of his classes had asked Phædrus, bitterly, if his efforts to stop accred- itation meant he was trying to prevent them from getting an education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phædrus said no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one student, apparently a partisan of the governor, said angrily that the legislature would prevent the school from losing its accreditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phædrus asked how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student said they would post police to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phædrus pondered this for a while, then realized the enormity of the student’s misconception of what accreditation was all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, for the next day’s lecture, he wrote out his defense of what he was doing. This was the Church of Reason lecture, which, in contrast to his usual sketchy lecture notes, was very long and very carefully elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It began with reference to a newspaper article about a country church building with an electric beer sign hanging right over the front entrance. The building had been sold and was being used as a bar. One can guess that some classroom laughter started at this point. The college was well known for drunken partying and the image vaguely fit. The article said a number of people had complained to the church officials about it. It had been a Catholic church, and the priest who had been delegated to respond to the criticism had sounded quite irritated about the whole thing. To him it had revealed an incredible ignorance of what a church really was. Did they think that bricks and boards and glass constituted a church? Or the shape of the roof? Here, posing as piety was an example of the very materialism the church opposed. The building in question was not holy ground. It had been desanctified. That was the end of it. The beer sign resided over a bar, not a church, and those who couldn’t tell the difference were simply revealing something about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phædrus said the same confusion existed about the University and that was why loss of accreditation was hard to understand. The real University is not a material object. It is not a group of buildings that can be defended by police. He explained that when a college lost its accreditation, nobody came and shut down the school. There were no legal penalties, no fines, no jail sentences. Classes did not stop. Everything went on just as before. Students got the same education they would if the school didn’t lose its accreditation. All that would happen, Phædrus said, would simply be an official recognition of a condition that already existed. It would be similar to excommunication. What would happen is that the real University, which no legislature can dictate to and which can never be identified by any location of bricks or boards or glass, would simply declare that this place was no longer &quot;holy ground.&quot; The real University would vanish from it, and all that would be left was the bricks and the books and the material manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must have been a strange concept to all of the students, and I can imagine him waiting for a long time for it to sink in, and perhaps then waiting for the question, What do you think the real University is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His notes, in response to this question, state the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real University, he said, has no specific location. It owns no property, pays no salaries and receives no material dues. The real University is a state of mind. It is that great heritage of rational thought that has been brought down to us through the centuries and which does not exist at any specific location. It’s a state of mind which is regenerated throughout the centuries by a body of people who traditionally carry the title of professor, but even that title is not part of the real University. The real University is nothing less than the continuing body of reason itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this state of mind, &quot;reason,&quot; there’s a legal entity which is unfortunately called by the same name but which is quite another thing. This is a nonprofit corporation, a branch of the state with a specific address. It owns property, is capable of paying salaries, of receiving money and of responding to legislative pressures in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this second university, the legal corporation, cannot teach, does not generate new knowledge or evaluate ideas. It is not the real University at all. It is just a church building, the setting, the location at which conditions have been made favorable for the real church to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion continually occurs in people who fail to see this difference, he said, and think that control of the church buildings implies control of the church. They see professors as employees of the second university who should abandon reason when told to and take orders with no backtalk, the same way employees do in other corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They see the second university, but fail to see the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember reading this for the first time and remarking about the analytic craftsmanship displayed. He avoided splitting the University into fields or departments and dealing with the results of that analysis. He also avoided the traditional split into students, faculty and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you split it either of those ways you get a lot of dull stuff that doesn’t really tell you much you can’t get out of the official school bulletin. But Phædrus split it between &quot;the church&quot; and &quot;the location,&quot; and once this cleavage is made the same rather dull and imponderable institution seen in the bulletin suddenly is seen with a degree of clarity that wasn’t previously available. On the basis of this cleavage he provided explanations for a number of puzzling but normal aspects of University life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these explanations he returned to the analogy of the religious church. The citizens who build such a church and pay for it probably have in mind that they’re doing this for the community. A good sermon can put the parishioners in a right frame of mind for the coming week. Sunday school will help the children grow up right. The minister who delivers the sermon and directs the Sunday school understands these goals and normally goes along with them, but he also knows that his primary goals are not to serve the community. His primary goal is always to serve God. Normally there’s no conflict but occasionally one creeps in when trustees oppose the minister’s sermons and threaten reduction of funds. That happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A true minister, in such situations, must act as though he’d never heard the threats. His primary goal isn’t to serve the members of the community, but always God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of the Church of Reason, Phædrus said, is always Socrates’ old goal of truth, in its ever-changing forms, as it’s revealed by the process of rationality. Everything else is subordinate to that. Normally this goal is in no conflict with the location goal of improving the citizenry, but on occasion some conflict arises, as in the case of Socrates himself. It arises when trustees and legislators who’ve contributed large amounts of time and money to the location take points of view in opposition to the professors’ lectures or public statements. They can then lean on the administration by threatening to cut off funds if the professors don’t say what&lt;br /&gt;
they want to hear. That happens too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True churchmen in such situations must act as though they had never heard these threats. Their primary goal never is to serve the community ahead of everything else. Their primary goal is to serve, through reason, the goal of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was what he meant by the Church of Reason. There was no question but that it was a concept that was deeply felt by him. He was regarded as something of a troublemaker but was never censured for it in any proportion to the amount of trouble he made. What saved him from the wrath of everyone around him was partly an unwillingness to give any support to the enemies of the college, but also partly a begrudging understanding that all of his troublemaking was ultimately motivated by a mandate they were never free from themselves: the mandate to speak the rational truth.&lt;/p&gt;

Chapter 7: Intellectual property law &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some progress has been made on &lt;strong&gt;copyright and neighbouring&lt;/strong&gt; rights. The amendments to the Criminal Code regarding breach of copyright and increasing the maximum prison term have had a positive impact. The number of court proceedings has increased. They lasted between one month and about three years. The website on copyright protection established by the Ministry of Culture is not regularly updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administrative court instructed the second-instance commission to annul within one month its decisions suspending the activities of two of the three collective rights management societies. However, this has yet to be done. The Constitutional Court annulled some provisions of the rulebook on the levy scheme and the rulebook on the calculation of royalties of the Association for Protection of Copyright on Musical Works (ZAMP). Concerns have been expressed about this decision, which relates to interpretation of Article 146(6) of the current Copyright Law. The court stated that copyright royalties should be calculated only on the profit, not on the income, from using a copyright work. Overall, in the area of copyright and related rights the country is moderately advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been good progress in the area of &lt;strong&gt;industrial property rights&lt;/strong&gt;. The country became a member of the European Patent Organisation. The State Office for Industrial Property (SOIP) is responsible for implementing the European Patent Convention (EPC). A new Law on Industrial Property provides the basis for implementing the EPC. Alignment has yet to be confirmed. Several pieces of legislation implementing the new Law on Industrial Property have been adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Law on Plant-Breeders’ Rights was enacted. Alignment has yet to be confirmed. The International Convention for Protection of New Varieties of Plants has been ratified. More staff were recruited to the SOIP, bringing the total number to 34. The SOIP and the Ministry of Economy undertook a number of public awareness-raising activities. The SOIP, in cooperation with the European Patent Office, organised seminars on patent applications and drafting patent claims. Alignment of the trademark law is not satisfactory. Overall, in the area of legislative alignment on industrial property rights the country is advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been good progress on &lt;strong&gt;enforcement&lt;/strong&gt;, both at the borders and throughout the country. However, piracy and counterfeiting remain widespread. A national strategy and an action plan for building up the capacity needed to implement and enforce the &lt;em&gt;acquis&lt;/em&gt; in the area of copyright, related rights and industrial property rights was adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coordination Body for Intellectual Property (CBIP) was active, taking frequent and well-coordinated action across the country. The government was informed about CBIP activities twice a month and provided support. Appropriate criminal and misdemeanour procedures were initiated and outlets were closed. Seized goods that had been the subject of a court decision were publicly destroyed with media coverage. However, the efforts made to combat counterfeiting are not sufficient. The goods seized were mainly audio/video CDs, clothing, cigarettes and alcohol. Equipment used to produce counterfeit goods and computers running unlicensed software are confiscated but not destroyed. Cooperation with the Agency for Managing Confiscated Property has yet to be established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some progress was made on the awareness, experience and qualifications of inspectors and judges. The State Market Inspectorate was provided with extensive IT equipment to strengthen its capacity and received training on intellectual property rights (IPR). The customs administration increased its IPR enforcement activities. IPR protection has been made an integral part of the training curriculum of the academy for training judges and prosecutors from the 2009-2010 academic year on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Justice has supported the work of the specialised IPR departments of the 13 basic courts and submitted monthly statistics on IPR-related court proceedings to the SOIP. The number of misdemeanour, civil and criminal proceedings is unsatisfactory. About 40 copyright and industrial property cases were completed in 2008. Fines and other sanctions were imposed in about half of them. However, fines were not imposed effectively and averaged €250, ranging from €15 to €10,000. A reliable enforcement record has yet to be established and the method for collecting statistical data on enforcement is weak. Some awareness-raising activities have been carried out, but the overall level of awareness about IPR is still unsatisfactory. Although the country has started to address its priorities, the resources allocated are still insufficient for proper IPR enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some progress has been made towards strengthening the legal framework and enhancing administrative capacity and institutional cooperation in the area of intellectual property law. The track record regarding the number and value of goods seized and destroyed and the number of court proceedings initiated and completed is not yet satisfactory. Overall, enforcement, though improving, is not yet satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
