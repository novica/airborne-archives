Harald Schenker shared his insight on the local civil society:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&quot;Let’s now get to my favourite, the so-called civil society, some of them my friends and colleagues, others people I worked with, and others, finally, people I tried to work with. To all of them I have harsh words: civil engagement is not a job.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Civil engagement cannot be equated to euros. As long as Macedonia’s civil society sector continues merely to be a job-generating machine, you cannot expect social change, except for those working in the sector, of course.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The new, donor-driven bourgeoisie has installed itself comfortably and conformably in the centre of society, from where it aspires to more and learns to despise the have-nots, while not so secretly living in fear of being next to join those have-nots - if they are found too critical either of the power structures or the donors themselves. This is the material that kills social change.&quot;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve written in the past on the same &lt;a href=&quot;/node/669&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/a&gt;, although from a different point of view. Needless to say I agree with what Harald wrote. I think it would be a safe bet to say that most [all?] of the ex-YU countries have similar problems [or failures] of their civil society. A 2006 paper [dead link to pdf &#039;From the Civil sector to Civil society&#039;] from Ismet Sejfija has some sharp commentary as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&quot;In Bosnia-Herzegovina, people working in civil society organisations who analyse developments in this sector often talk about “projectomania”. The term denotes an uncritical attitude by NGOs whose entire programme of activities revolves around project funding, and whose priority is to develop projects that focus on compliance with the sponsors’ criteria, often without considering their practical relevance and viability.&quot;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why I&#039;m referencing all these writings is my stumble upon couple of new Macedonian NGO projects in the last week. The first is called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reagiram.mk/&quot;&gt;I react&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and is a service for reporting municipal communal problems, and the second is called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sledigiparite.mk/&quot;&gt;Follow the money&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and is a service for tracking municipal taxes and expenditures. Both caught my attention because I was already familiar with two other civil society projects that more-or-less provided the same services: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://popravi.mk/&quot;&gt;Repair it&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fiskalenmonitor.mk/&quot;&gt;Fiscal monitor&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. [It should be noted that the &quot;react&quot; people stated that their service had significant differences from &quot;repair&quot;]. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if my memory is not faulty, these two are not the only ones having doubles. And this is the research proposal: In the given pool of donors in the country, try to find out if they coordinate and collaborate on granting funds to civil society. Do they keep an eye on &#039;reinventing the wheel&#039;? How many double projects are there so far and what is their success rate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you are reading this and decide to apply for a research grant, please leave a comment so someone else doesn&#039;t do the same thing and we end up with two reports. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;links inline&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;en first last&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/node/754&quot; class=&quot;language-link&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
