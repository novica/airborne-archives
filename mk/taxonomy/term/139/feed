Џонатан Зитрејн за &lt;a href=&quot;http://futureoftheinternet.org/the-pc-is-dead-why-no-angry-nerds&quot;&gt;смртта на персоналниот компјутер:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially troubling as governments have come to realize that this framework makes their own censorship vastly easier: what used to be a Sisyphean struggle to stanch the distribution of books, tracts, and then websites is becoming a few takedown notices to a handful of digital gatekeepers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Долг &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.e-flux.com/journal/view/232&quot;&gt;разговор со Џулијан Асанж&lt;/a&gt; и &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.e-flux.com/journal/view/238&quot;&gt;дел 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correct, and optimistic about any organization, or any country, that engages in censorship. We see now that the US State Department is trying to censor us. We can also look at it in the following way. The birds and the bees, and other things that can’t actually change human power relationships, are free. They’re left unmolested by human beings because they don’t matter. In places where speech is free, and where censorship does not exist or is not obvious, the society is so sewn up—so depoliticized, so fiscalized in its basic power relationships—that it doesn’t matter what you say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, there is an idea that these great American companies, Facebook and Twitter, gave the Egyptian people this revolution and liberated Egypt. But the most popular guide for the revolutionaries was a document that spread throughout the soccer clubs in Egypt, which themselves were the most significant revolutionary community groups. If you read this document, you see that on the first page it says to be careful not to use Twitter and Facebook as they are being monitored. On the last page: do not use Twitter or Facebook. That is the most popular guide for the Egyptian revolution. And then we see Hillary Clinton trying to say that this was a revolution by Twitter and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Од коментарите на &lt;a href=&quot;/node/661&quot;&gt;(Не)познато (не)знаење&lt;/a&gt;: Стамен Филипов - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ihr.org.mk/mk/component/content/article?id=131&quot;&gt;Причини за неизвршување на одлуките на уставниот суд&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Осврт на промената на конзервативните вредности - &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2011/09/libertarians-and-conservatives-must.html&quot;&gt;Libertarians and Conservatives must choose: Competitive Enterprise or Idolatry of Property&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who actually reads Adam Smith also knows that he went on and on about that &quot;fair and open&quot; part! Especially how excessive disparities of wealth and income destroy competition. Unlike today&#039;s conservatives, who grew up in a post-WWII flattened social order without major wealth-castes, Smith lived immersed in class-rooted oligarchy, of the kind that ruined markets, freedom and science across nearly 99% of human history. He knew the real enemy, first hand and denounced it in terms that he never used for mere bureaucrats..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
